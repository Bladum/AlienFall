## VI. Environmental Storytelling Principles

### Show Don't Tell

**Use Environment:**
- Debris shows recent battle
- Bodies show enemy types
- Damage shows weapon types
- Propaganda shows faction ideology
- Architecture shows culture

### Emotional Beats

**Guide Player Feeling:**
- Tight corridors = claustrophobia
- Wide vistas = freedom/vulnerability
- Familiar places = nostalgia/horror
- Ruin beauty = tragedy
- Perfection = unease

### Pacing Through Environment

**Control Tension:**
- Narrow â†’ Wide: Relief
- Dark â†’ Light: Hope or exposure
- Quiet â†’ Loud: Shock
- Familiar â†’ Strange: Unease
- Order â†’ Chaos: Breakdown

### Cultural Identity

**Each Faction Distinct:**
- Architecture style
- Color schemes
- Signage language
- Technology level
- Aesthetic choices
