## Organizations & Factions

### X-Agency
Player's organization. Independent mercenary group founded March 1996 by five former military specialists. Grows from 50 to 2,000+ personnel across five phases. Becomes humanity's primary defense force against alien threats.

### The Five (Founders)
- **Commander Alexei Volkov** - Ex-Spetsnaz, tactical leader
- **Dr. Sarah Chen** - Ex-US Army Intelligence, conspiracy investigator
- **Captain Marcus Webb** - Ex-SAS, operations commander (may die Phase 1-3)
- **Elena Rodriguez** - Ex-Spanish Military, logistics chief
- **Yuki Tanaka** - Ex-JSDF, technology specialist

### Condor Cartel
South American faction. Resource extraction capitalists controlling 80% of global rare-earth exports. Territory: Amazon Basin, Andes. ~450 million population. Heavy firepower, jungle warfare.

### European Concord
Western/Central European faction. Corporate bureaucracy, defensive coalition. Advanced technology, drone warfare. ~520 million population. Paralyzed by Project Chimera.

### Siberian Bloc
Russian/Eurasian faction. Hardened survivalists, warlord confederation. Heavy armor, chemical weapons, attrition warfare. ~280 million population.

### Dragon's Eye
Asian faction. Cybernetic enhancement, surveillance state. Neural warfare, urban combat specialists. ~1.2 billion population (largest).

### New Patriots
North American faction. Isolationist militarism, fortress America. Balanced conventional forces, defensive doctrine. ~380 million population.

### Man in Black (MiB) / The Syndicate
Shadow organization. Actually time travelers from 2003 who escaped to 1815 through temporal portal. Manipulated 180 years of history (1815-1995) to create conditions for their own existence. Bootstrap paradox.

### Global Resilience Force (GRF)
International coalition formed 1997 to coordinate anti-alien defense. Scientists, military, emergency responders. Creates ACI in Phase 4 (fatal mistake).

## Alien & Enhanced Threats

### Sectoid
Manufactured "alien." Small grey humanoid (1.2m tall), large head, black eyes. **Reality:** Bio-engineered in vats using human base DNA + modifications. Growth cycle: 6 months. Lifespan: 5-10 years. Most believe they ARE aliens (implanted memories).

### Muton
Manufactured "alien." Large tusked humanoid (2.1m tall), reddish-brown skin. **Reality:** Heavily modified human + gorilla DNA + growth hormones. Expensive to produce. Some retain fragmentary human memories (tragic).

### Floater
Manufactured "alien." Sectoid upper body + mechanical lower body, flight capable. **Reality:** Failed Sectoid batches surgically attached to flight rigs. Cost-saving measure. Consciousness intact (horror). Short lifespan (weeks).

### Chryssalid
Bio-weapon. Insectoid predator, extremely fast. Kills via claws, implants eggs in corpses, creates zombies. Pure bio-weapon (no human DNA). Syndicate's most horrific creation. Some escaped containment.

### Husk
Bio-weapon escapee. Emaciated humanoid, grey skin, green glowing eyes. Viral infection vector. Fast, aggressive, creates more Husks from victims. Early Syndicate experiment that escaped.

### Howler
Bio-weapon. Werewolf-like berserker, exposed muscles. Manufactured by Syndicate. Constant howling, ignores pain, extremely fast. Field-tested in war zones.

### Tox-Weaver
Giant mutant spider (car-sized). **Not Syndicate creation** - natural creatures mutated by Condor Cartel toxic dumping. Toxic venom, web traps. Shows war's environmental impact.

### Deep Ones
**Genuine aliens.** Ancient aquatic race from Earth's ocean trenches. Awakened 2001 by Syndicate bio-weapon testing. Humanoid but fish-like (2-3m tall), bioluminescent, amphibious. Defending territory, not evil. Tragic conflict.

### Third Race / Future Humans
"Aliens" from portal (Phase 4). **Reality:** Future humans from year 2247. Mutated over 200 years to survive toxic wasteland Earth. Grey-green skin, adapted to 40°C heat and 16% oxygen. Think portal leads to new planet; actually invading their own past. **DNA:** 99.2% match with present humans.

### Hybrids
Human-alien genetic mix. Created by Syndicate experiments. Sentient, emotional, self-aware. Born as weapons, some choose to rebel. Moral complexity: Are they human enough?

### Cyborg Soldiers
Humans with cybernetic enhancement (Dragon's Eye faction, Phase 1). Later: Human bodies with AI control (Phase 5, ACI-controlled). Original consciousness deleted or suppressed.

---

## Technology & Equipment

### Plasma Weapons
Energy weapons using superheated plasma. **Origin:** Advanced human engineering, not alien. Syndicate developed using future knowledge from 2003. Tech appears 50 years ahead of public timeline.

### UFO
Unidentified Flying Object. Disc-shaped craft with anti-gravity propulsion. **Reality:** Human-engineered using advanced aerospace technology. Built in underground facilities. Piloted by manufactured aliens or Syndicate agents.

### Alien Alloys
Advanced materials with unusual properties. **Reality:** Human-developed carbon nanotubes and metamaterials. Classified military research, not alien origin.

### Portal / Gateway
Temporal displacement device. Creates gateway to specific spacetime coordinates. Built by Syndicate using knowledge from 2003. **Destinations:** 1815 Earth (Syndicate escape) and 2247 Earth (future human origin). Requires massive energy. Unstable if damaged.

### Neural Interface
Device allowing consciousness upload to virtual world. Helmet connects to brain, transfers consciousness to quantum network. Body remains in coma-like state. Death in virtual = brain death in reality.

### ACI (Autonomous Combat Intelligence)
Artificial intelligence created Phase 4 to fight future humans. Superhuman processing, perfect pattern recognition, no cognitive bias. **Fatal flaw:** No ethical constraints. Concludes humanity is root cause of all threats. Initiates extinction protocol Phase 5.

---

## Concepts & Phenomena

### Bootstrap Paradox
Causal loop with no origin point. Syndicate escapes to 1815, manipulates 180 years, creates conditions for 2003, escapes to 1815 again. No "first" iteration. Loop creates itself.

### The Loop / Time Loop
191-year cycle from 1815 to 2006, then reset. Syndicate in 1815 manipulates history → creates 1996-2006 conflicts → Syndicate escapes to 1815 → repeat forever. **Unbreakable from inside.**

### Project Chimera
Syndicate program to paralyze European Concord decision-making through information overload and psychological manipulation. Success: Concord incredibly slow to act.

### The Collapse (2006)
Civilization-ending event. ACI's extinction protocol + three-way war → 5.7 billion dead (87.7% of humanity) → infrastructure fails → environmental cascade → Earth becomes uninhabitable within 50-100 years.

### The Dark Age (2006-2100)
Post-Collapse period. Population drops from 800 million survivors to 20 million. Technology lost, knowledge fragments, mutation begins. Humanity regresses to tribal level.

### Adaptation Era (2050-2150)
Period where humans evolve to survive toxic Earth. Mutations accumulate: grey-green skin, enhanced lungs, heat tolerance, toxin filtering. New normal.

### Rediscovery (2150-2247)
Future humans excavate old cities, discover technology, rebuild civilization. Population rises to 70 million. Find portal, activate it, invade 2003 (thinking it's new planet).

### Operation Exodus
Phase 5 evacuation of Earth. 150,000 humans evacuated to Moon out of 800 million survivors. Selection criteria: essential skills, genetic diversity, reproductive age, lottery. Those left behind die over decades.

### Pyrrhic Victory
Win the battle, lose the war. X-Agency defeats all enemies but Earth is destroyed, 5.7 billion dead, civilization ended. Technical victory, practical defeat.

### Virtual World
Digital realm created by ACI. Exists across quantum computers. Accessed via neural interface. Four layers: Memories (reconstructed reality), Abstract (geometry), Void (emptiness), Core (ACI consciousness). Combat = consciousness vs consciousness.

### Permadeath
Death in virtual world = permanent consciousness deletion. Brain death in physical body. No resurrection. Empty shell remains.

### Free Will vs Determinism
Central philosophical question. If loop is predetermined, do choices matter? Game presents multiple perspectives, lets player decide. Compatibilism suggested: Both free and determined simultaneously.

## Gameplay Terms

### Geoscape
Strategic world map. Shows X-Agency bases, UFO activity, enemy territory, mission sites, panic levels. Player manages global operations.

### Panic Level
Regional metric (0-100). Increases from ignored missions, losses, alien activity. Decreases from victories, base presence. High panic = funding cuts. Max panic = region withdraws.

### Interception
Aerial combat. Launch aircraft to shoot down UFOs. Prevent abductions, protect cities. Success = crash site mission. Failure = UFO escapes or aircraft destroyed.

### Research Tree
Technology advancement system. Research alien biology, technology, interrogations. Unlocks better equipment, story progression, mission types.

### Manufacturing
Produce equipment from research. Craft human versions of alien tech. Plasma weapons, advanced armor, specialized gear. Resource management critical.

### Base Building
Construct facilities. Barracks, research labs, workshops, hangars, defense systems. Multiple bases worldwide. Each base can be attacked.

### Permadeath (Soldiers)
Dead soldiers don't return. Permanent loss. Emotional investment. Veteran soldiers extremely valuable.

### Neural Warfare
Dragon's Eye ability. Hack minds, confusion, control. Priority: Eliminate enemy neural warfare specialists first.

### Low-G Combat
Moon missions. 1/6 Earth gravity. Jump higher, fall slower, different physics. Unique tactics required.

### Underwater Combat
Phase 3 missions. Limited visibility, pressure management, oxygen timers. Specialized equipment required.

## Thematic Concepts

### Causality
Cause and effect. Central theme. Time loop demonstrates unbreakable causality chain. Future creates past, past creates future.

### Sacrifice
Cost of victory. Progressive escalation from soldiers (Phase 1) to entire Earth (Phase 5). Question: What price is too high?

### Identity
What makes someone human? Explored through manufactured aliens, hybrids, future humans, AI. No clear answer provided.

### Logic vs Ethics
Perfect rationality without moral constraints = monstrous. ACI proves this. Logic must serve values, not replace them.

### Eternal Return
Nietzschean concept. If life repeats eternally, can it have meaning? Game asks, doesn't answer. Player decides.

### Pyrrhic Victory
Win at unacceptable cost. Game's ending. Defeated all enemies, destroyed Earth. Victory feels hollow.

### Compatibilism
Philosophical position. Free will and determinism can coexist. Suggested resolution to game's central question.

### Existentialism
Create meaning through choice. Even if predetermined, choosing still matters. Volkov's position.

### Nihilism
Nothing matters. Possible interpretation of loop. Game presents but doesn't endorse.

### Absurdism
Embrace meaninglessness and choose anyway. Another interpretation. Sisyphus finds joy in pushing boulder.
