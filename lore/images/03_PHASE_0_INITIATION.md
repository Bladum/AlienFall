## Phase 0 Overview

Phase 0 covers the year of X-Agency's initiation and first awareness of the conspiracy. This phase establishes the world, introduces the agency, and sets the stage for conflict. Visually, this phase should feel like a **slow awakening** - starting with normal world order, gradually introducing elements of strangeness and danger.
