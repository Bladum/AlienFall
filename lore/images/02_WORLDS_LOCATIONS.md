- Skyscrapers: Partially destroyed, nature reclaiming them
- Rubble: Piles of building debris (gray #808080)
- Vegetation overgrowth: Vines covering structures (dark green)
- Exposed interiors: Showing destroyed rooms and equipment

RUINS VISIBLE:
- Window remnants: Dark openings in structures
- Doorways: Leading to unknown interiors
- Structural damage: Showing violence or decay
- Metal framework: Rusted remains (#A0522D)

VEGETATION:
- Ivy and vines: Covering most structures
- Trees: Growing through buildings (#2d5a2d)
- Flowers: Suggesting nature recovery (color accents)
- Fungi: On damp surfaces (brown-yellow #8B6914)

HUMAN REMNANTS:
- Structures: Evidence of survival (makeshift shelters in ruins)
- Artifacts: Recognizable human technology (cars, roads)
- Art: Graffiti or messages visible (suggesting survivors)
- Camps: Small settlements visible in protected areas

ATMOSPHERE:
- Abandonment (no active civilization)
- Nature triumph (reclaiming human space)
- Ancient history feeling (though only 200 years in future)
- Beauty and tragedy mixed
- Mystery (what happened to humans?)

SPECIFIC DETAILS:
- Time passage: 200 years of decay visible
- Technology: Remnants of advanced equipment rusting
- Skeletons/bones: Suggesting massive death (subtle)
- Written records: Visible remnants of human writing
- Maps and signs: Still partially readable

LIGHTING:
- Daylight: Filtered through vegetation
- Green-tinted: Suggesting atmospheric composition change
- Shadows: From overgrown vegetation
- Overcast feeling: Haze suggesting climate change

SCALE ELEMENTS:
- Third Wave aliens: Visible among ruins (showing perspective)
- Human settlers: Small figures showing survival attempts
- Architecture: Massive buildings showing human achievement

Style: Isometric pixel art, 18-22 colors (overgrown/nature palette).
Lighting: Filtered daylight through vegetation, greenish tint.
Perspective: Show urban scale with nature reclamation.
Emphasis: Nature's triumph, human extinction mystery, post-human era.

## Usage Notes

**Consistency Across Locations:**
- All use isometric perspective
- Color palettes remain consistent per biome
- Scale indicators (personnel, vehicles) provide reference
- Environmental storytelling through visual details

**For AI Generation:**
- More detailed prompts = more consistent results
- Specify color hex codes for faction/biome consistency
- Request "pixel art" explicitly
- Ask for "hard edges" (no anti-aliasing)
