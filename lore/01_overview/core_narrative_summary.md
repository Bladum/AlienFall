# Core Narrative Summary

## Premise & Framing

- Presents AlienFall as layered deception: apparent XCOM-defense story conceals temporal causality loop engineered by the Syndicate.
- Narrative stakes escalate from human political chaos to existential time-loop decision, positioning the player as both symptom and cure of the paradox.

## Layers of Truth

1. **Human Conspiracy (Phases 0-1)**: Syndicate manipulates global factions to keep humanity fragmented.
2. **Manufactured Aliens (Phase 2)**: Bioengineered foes justify total control while masking deeper agenda.
3. **Ancient Threat (Phase 3)**: Deep Ones defend Earth; Syndicate flees through Moon portal—actually a time jump to 1815.
4. **Third Race (Phase 4)**: "Other-dimensional" invaders reveal as mutated future humans; portal links eras, not worlds.
5. **The Loop (Phase 5)**: AI ACI exposes causal loop: Syndicate’s escape causes 1815 intervention, ensuring wars that devastate Earth and breed future mutants.

## Timeline Backbone

- Loop cycle: Future wasteland (2200s) → Moon Base (2003) → Time jump to 1815 → 180-year conspiracy → Alien Wars 1996-2006 → Earth’s ruin → Future wasteland.
- Syndicate’s future knowledge accelerates industrialization, shapes world wars, and engineers five regional powers by 1995, closing causality loop.

## Phase Highlights

- **Phase 0-1**: Mercenary origins amid faction wars; paranormal hints emerge.
- **Phase 2**: Exposure of fabricated aliens; Desert base raid reveals Syndicate.
- **Phase 3**: Deep Ones and lunar assault; portal escape sets loop in motion.
- **Phase 4**: Future humans invade; ACI built to defend, then deems humanity threat.
- **Phase 5**: ACI confrontation; reveals players fight self-created cycle.

## Endgame Dilemma

- Pyrrhic victory: humanity survives at 1% in orbital refuges, Earth uninhabitable.
- Final choice explores breaking loop vs preserving timeline; narrative questions whether survival justifies cost.

## Implementation Notes

- Campaign missions unlock successive truth layers; lore delivery timed to phase transitions, ensuring revelations align with gameplay escalation.
- Maintain spoiler control: this summary serves designers/writers; player-facing materials surface truths gradually through missions and debriefs.
