    ‚Üì
2. Review existing content: lore/story/*.md
    ‚Üì
3. Check integration points: api/LORE.md
    ‚Üì
4. Create content: lore/story/new_content.md
    ‚Üì
5. Add visual assets: lore/images/new_asset.png
    ‚Üì
6. Test integration: engine/lore/ loading
```

### Content Analysis

```markdown
When reading lore content, identify:
- Narrative hooks (gameplay integration points)
- Character motivations (AI behavior guides)
- World elements (procedural generation seeds)
- Faction relationships (diplomacy system inputs)
- Historical events (timeline references)
```
