## How Factions Were Created (Hidden Truth)

### The Syndicate's Design (1980-1995)

**Man in Black Orchestration:**

Each faction was deliberately created:

1. **Condor Cartel:** Funded mining operations, armed cartels, created rare-earth monopoly
2. **European Concord:** Influenced EU formation, created bureaucratic paralysis (Project Chimera)
3. **Siberian Bloc:** Guided USSR collapse, empowered warlords, created harsh conditions
4. **Dragon's Eye:** Funded Chinese tech advancement, promoted cybernetic research
5. **New Patriots:** Encouraged isolationism, armed militias, promoted paranoia

**Purpose:**
- Fragment humanity (prevent global unity)
- Create perpetual conflict (weaken all)
- Prevent cooperation (easier to control)
- Test weapons (paranormal bio-weapons)
- Prepare for Phase 2 (fake alien invasion)

**Result:**
- By 1996, five balanced powers
- All hostile to each other
- All controllable by Syndicate
- None can achieve dominance
- Perfect chaos

### Recommended Tactics

**vs Condor:** Keep distance, avoid jungle, use precision
**vs European:** Fast assault before full deployment, EMP drones
**vs Siberian:** Avoid tanks, flank, anti-armor essential
**vs Dragon's Eye:** Counter-electronic warfare, expect ambushes
**vs New Patriots:** Combined arms, no simple solution

## Summary

**Five Factions:**
1. Condor Cartel - Resource barons (heavy firepower)
2. European Concord - Corporate bureaucracy (advanced tech)
3. Siberian Bloc - Hardened survivors (heavy armor)
4. Dragon's Eye - Cybernetic enhancement (neural warfare)
5. New Patriots - Isolationist military (balanced forces)

**X-Agency:** Independent mercenaries navigating between them

**Hidden Truth:** All orchestrated by Syndicate time travelers from 2003

**Phase 1 Role:** Primary opposition, contracts, geopolitical complexity
