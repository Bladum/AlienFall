## Overview

**Name:** The Third Race, Future Strain, Homo Adaptation, "The Aliens"  
**True Nature:** Mutated humans from Earth's future (2200-2300 AD)  
**Origin:** Earth, 200-300 years after 2006  
**Homeworld:** Future Earth (toxic wasteland)  
**First Appearance:** Phase 4 (2003-2004)  
**Arrival Method:** Portal from future Earth to Moon Base (2003)

**The Core Truth:** The "Third Race aliens" are not extraterrestrial. They are descendants of humanity, evolved/mutated after Earth became a toxic wasteland. They invade their own past, not knowing they're attacking their ancestors. The player fights them for years before discovering the horrifying truth.

---

## The Terrible Truth

### Not Aliens, But Future Humans

When the Third Race emerges from the Moon portal in Phase 4, everyone assumes they're:
- Extradimensional beings
- Aliens from another planet
- Invaders from parallel universe
- Genuinely foreign life

**All assumptions are wrong.**

They are **humans from Earth's future**, approximately 2200-2300 AD. The portal doesn't connect to another PLACEâ€”it connects to another TIME.

### How the Discovery Happens (Phase 4)

**Early Clues (Missed Initially):**
- Humanoid body structure (bilateral symmetry, five-fingered hands)
- Carbon-based biology (Earth-standard amino acids)
- DNA analysis shows 99.2% match with human genome
- Technology uses recognizable engineering principles
- Combat tactics suggest human military training adapted

**The Revelation Mission:**

X-Agency forces enter the portal (2004) to attack Third Race homeworld:

**Expected:** Alien planet, bizarre environment, completely foreign  
**Reality:** Earth. Recognizable geography. Ruins of human cities.

**Specific discoveries:**
- Statue of Liberty (corroded, but unmistakable) in ruins of New York
- Eiffel Tower (collapsed) in toxic wasteland of Paris
- Great Wall of China (partially buried) in radioactive desert
- Recognizable street signs (weathered, ancient)
- Human artifacts (cars, buildings, consumer products)
- **Databases with historical records matching known events**

**The Horror:**

Squad leader report (audio log):
*"Command, we've... we've reached the enemy homeworld. Coordinates confirmed. But this doesn't make sense. We're seeing ruins. Human ruins. This is... Oh god. This is Earth. This is our Earth. Command, the aliens aren't aliens. They're us. They're future humans. We've been killing our own descendants."*

## Future Earth (2200s)

### The Wasteland

**Environmental State (circa 2200-2300 AD):**

**Atmosphere:**
- Oxygen: 16% (down from 21% in 2000)
- CO2: 8% (up from 0.04% in 2000)
- Nitrogen: 72% (relatively stable)
- Toxins: Heavy metals, chemical compounds, radioactive particles
- Breathable: Only with filtration or biological adaptation

**Temperature:**
- Average: 35-45Â°C (95-113Â°F)
- Extremes: -20Â°C to 70Â°C (-4Â°F to 158Â°F)
- Seasonal variation: Chaotic
- Habitable zones: Minimal

**Radiation:**
- Background: 5-10x natural pre-2000 levels
- Hot zones: 50-100x natural levels (former cities, weapon sites)
- Safe zones: Rare, often underground

**Water:**
- Oceans: 70% biological dead zones
- Fresh water: Mostly contaminated
- Ice caps: Melted
- Clean water: Extremely rare, heavily fought over

**Soil:**
- Surface: Contaminated with heavy metals, toxins, radioactive isotopes
- Fertility: Nearly zero in most regions
- Agriculture: Only possible in sealed hydroponic facilities

**Biosphere:**
- Megafauna: Extinct (no mammals larger than rats)
- Plants: Adapted species only, heavily mutated
- Insects: Abundant, often mutated
- Fish: Deep ocean species survive; surface species extinct
- Humans: Mutated, adapted, barely surviving

### How Earth Became This

**2006-2050: Collapse Era**

After ACI's destruction (2006):
- Infrastructure collapse (no power, water, food production)
- Mass starvation (5+ billion deaths)
- Disease outbreaks (no medical system)
- Nuclear meltdowns (300+ reactors abandoned)
- Chemical plant explosions (industrial zones devastated)
- Atmospheric toxification (no regulation systems)

Survivors flee to:
- Remote regions (mountains, deserts, isolated islands)
- Underground bunkers (those who can reach them)
- Sealed habitats (limited capacity)

**2050-2100: Dark Age**

Remaining humans (estimated 50-200 million) struggle to survive:
- Nomadic tribes (scavenging ruins)
- Sealed colonies (strict resource rationing)
- Warlord territories (violent competition for resources)
- Technology regression (no manufacturing capability)
- Knowledge loss (oral tradition only)
- Genetic damage (radiation, toxins, inbreeding)

**2100-2200: Adaptation Era**

Humans begin adapting:
- Natural selection (radiation-resistant individuals survive)
- Forced evolution (toxic environment selects for mutations)
- Genetic drift (isolated populations diverge)
- Cultural fragmentation (unified humanity ceases to exist)
- Physical changes (described below)
- Psychological changes (adapted to harsh reality)

**2200-2300: Post-Human Era**

By 2200s, survivors are barely recognizable as "human":
- Physical mutations extensive
- Society fragmented into tribes
- Technology scavenged and repurposed
- History becomes myth
- Earth's past becomes legend
- **Discovery of portal technology in ancient ruins**

---

## Evolution and Mutation

### Physical Changes (200+ Years of Adaptation)

**Skeletal Structure:**
- Increased bone density (radiation resistance)
- Reinforced rib cage (protect vital organs from environmental hazards)
- Elongated limbs (heat dissipation in high-temperature environment)
- Modified spine (adapt to wearing heavy protective gear)
- Skull thickening (protect brain from radiation)

**Skin:**
- Thickened epidermis (5-10x human norm)
- Pigmentation changes (dark grey, greenish, or mottled)
- Integrated radiation shielding (melanin-like compounds)
- Reduced sweat glands (water conservation)
- Toxin-resistant pores

**Respiratory System:**
- Enhanced lung capacity (process low-oxygen atmosphere)
- Integrated filtration (particles and toxins)
- Modified alveoli (extract oxygen from thin atmosphere)
- Reduced oxygen dependence (anaerobic metabolism backup)

**Digestive System:**
- Process contaminated food/water
- Break down compounds toxic to baseline humans
- Reduced nutritional requirements (efficiency increase)
- Intestinal bacteria adapted to toxins

**Circulatory System:**
- Enhanced healing factors (rapid cellular repair)
- Radiation-resistant blood cells
- Heavy metal processing (liver and kidneys modified)
- Increased hemoglobin efficiency

**Nervous System:**
- Increased pain tolerance (constant environmental stress)
- Enhanced reflexes (survival necessity)
- Modified sensory input (adapted to toxic environment)
- Psychological resilience (trauma normalized)

**Reproductive System:**
- Reduced fertility (environmental stress)
- High infant mortality (only adapted survive)
- Accelerated maturation (shorter lifespans necessitate this)
- Genetic damage common (birth defects normalized)

### Appearance (By 2200s)

**Height:** 1.6-1.9m (similar to baseline humans, but leaner)  
**Build:** Thin, wiry, extremely efficient muscle structure  
**Skin:** Grey-green, mottled, thick, leathery texture  
**Eyes:** Large (adapted to dim light), protective membranes  
**Nose:** Reduced (integrated filtration in respiratory system)  
**Ears:** Streamlined (environmental adaptation)  
**Hair:** Mostly absent (environmental disadvantage)  
**Posture:** Slightly hunched (spinal adaptation to protective gear)

**Overall Impression:** Humanoid, but clearly NOT baseline human. Eerie, unsettling, "alien" appearance.

### Genetic Analysis (When Discovered)

**DNA Comparison:**
- 99.2% match with human genome
- 0.8% mutations (200+ years of extreme selection pressure)
- All mutations traceable to environmental adaptation
- Mitochondrial DNA matches human evolutionary tree
- Clear ancestry from Homo sapiens sapiens

**Conclusion:** Definitely human, but extensively adapted.

## Society and Culture

### Tribal Structure (2200s)

**Population:** 5-50 million total (estimates vary)

**Organization:**
- Fragmented tribes (100-5,000 members each)
- No unified government
- Warlord territories
- Occasional alliances (temporary, resource-driven)
- Violent competition for scarce resources

**Settlements:**
- Underground bunkers (repurposed pre-Collapse facilities)
- Sealed surface habitats (limited)
- Mobile camps (nomadic tribes)
- Ruins of ancient cities (scavenged, not inhabited)

### Technology Level

**Lost Technologies:**
- Manufacturing (no industrial base)
- Advanced medicine (no pharmaceutical production)
- Agriculture (no soil fertility)
- Modern communications (no satellite network)
- Computer systems (no microprocessor production)

**Retained Technologies:**
- Scavenged equipment (repaired and maintained)
- Improvised weapons (fabricated from ruins)
- Basic chemical processing (essential for survival)
- Water purification (critical technology)
- Renewable energy (solar, wind - scavenged panels)

**Rediscovered Technologies:**
- Portal device (found in ancient ruins, likely left by ACI)
- Dimensional physics (partially understood)
- Energy weapons (reverse-engineered from pre-Collapse tech)
- Genetic engineering (basic, used for medical purposes)

### Culture and Beliefs

**Mythology:**
- "Golden Age" before the Collapse
- Legends of ancestors who "killed the world"
- Stories of AI that betrayed humanity
- Prophecies of "new world" beyond portal
- Oral tradition (no written records remain)

**Values:**
- Survival above all
- Distrust of technology (caused Collapse)
- Respect for scavengers (essential role)
- Fear of "old places" (radioactive ruins)
- Hope for escape (portal offers salvation)

**Language:**
- Descended from English, Chinese, Spanish (mixed dialects)
- Heavily evolved (200+ years of linguistic drift)
- Many words lost (concepts no longer relevant)
- New words created (describe post-Collapse reality)

**Social Structure:**
- Elders (knowledge keepers, decision makers)
- Warriors (protect tribe, raid others)
- Scavengers (find resources in ruins)
- Engineers (maintain critical technology)
- Children (rare, highly valued)

### Daily Life

**Survival Challenges:**
- Find clean water (hours per day)
- Find edible food (scavenging or hydroponic)
- Avoid radiation zones (navigation critical)
- Repair protective gear (constant maintenance)
- Defend from hostile tribes (frequent conflict)
- Maintain shelter integrity (environmental pressure)

**Life Expectancy:** 30-50 years (harsh conditions, limited medicine)

**Birth Rate:** Low (environmental stress, reduced fertility)

**Mortality Rate:** High (disease, violence, accidents, environmental)

## Discovery of the Portal

### The Ancient Ruins

Deep within what was once Arizona desert, sealed underground facility:

**The Site:**
- Military bunker from pre-Collapse era
- ACI research facility (built 2004-2005)
- Abandoned during Collapse (2006)
- Sealed automatically, preserved for centuries
- Discovered by scavengers circa 2250

**The Technology:**
- Portal device (inactive)
- Power source (depleted)
- Computer systems (dormant)
- Research notes (degraded, partially readable)
- Instructions (fragmentary)

### The Activation (2260-2280)

Scavenger tribe dedicates years to understanding technology:

**Phase 1: Power Restoration (2260-2270)**
- Scavenge solar panels
- Restore power generation
- Activate auxiliary systems
- Access computer databases (fragmentary)

**Phase 2: Understanding (2270-2275)**
- Decode research notes
- Understand portal purpose (connect distant location)
- Mistranslation: "Distant location" = "Another planet" (actually another time)
- Believe portal leads to habitable world

**Phase 3: Repair (2275-2280)**
- Fabricate replacement parts
- Restore portal functionality
- Test activation sequences
- Prepare for expedition

**The Hope:**

Future humans believe:
- Portal leads to new world (fresh start)
- Habitable environment (escape wasteland)
- Resources available (support colonization)
- Salvation for tribe (perhaps all humanity)

**The Reality:**
- Portal connects to 2003 (their past)
- "New world" is Earth before Collapse
- Resources are abundant (because it's their past)
- But they're invading their own timeline

**They don't know this.**

---

## The Invasion (Phase 4, 2003-2005)

### First Contact (2003)

**From Future Human Perspective:**

Scouts enter portal:
- Expect alien world
- Arrive on Moon (unexpected)
- See Earth in sky (familiar, but pristine!)
- Realize: This is Earth, but NOT their Earth
- Conclusion: Parallel universe OR another planet in different system
- **Never consider: This is their past**

**From X-Agency Perspective:**

Dimensional portal opens on Moon:
- Unknown entities emerge
- Humanoid but mutated appearance
- Advanced weapons
- Hostile intentions
- Conclusion: Alien invasion, third wave

**Neither side realizes the truth.**

### The Conflict (2003-2005)

**Future Human Goals:**
- Secure portal site
- Establish beachhead
- Assess resources
- Begin terraforming (to match their environment)
- Eventually: Full colonization

**X-Agency Goals:**
- Defend Earth
- Investigate invaders
- Destroy portal
- Eliminate threat
- Protect humanity

**The Irony:** Both sides believe they're defending humanity.

### Escalation

**2003-2004: Reconnaissance**
- Small future human forces scout Earth
- Skirmishes with X-Agency
- Both sides assess enemy capabilities
- Casualties on both sides

**2004: Full Invasion**
- Future humans commit major forces
- Thousands cross through portal
- Battles across Earth
- X-Agency forms global coalition
- ACI created to defeat invaders

**2004-2005: Total War**
- Massive casualties
- Tactical nuclear weapons used (by both sides)
- Environmental damage (ironic: creating conditions for future wasteland)
- ACI defeats future humans with perfect efficiency
- Portal assaults (X-Agency enters future)

---

## The Moment of Truth

### The Discovery (2004-2005)

X-Agency forces enter portal to attack future human homeworld:

**Initial Reconnaissance:**
- Scouts report ruins
- Ruined human architecture identified
- Confusion: Why would aliens have human buildings?
- Hypothesis: They conquered Earth in parallel timeline
- **Wrong, but closer to truth**

**Deep Penetration:**
- Larger forces enter future Earth
- Explore ruins thoroughly
- Find irrefutable evidence: This is Earth, their Earth, in the future
- Historical records match known events
- Genetic evidence confirms: Future humans are their descendants

**The Report:**

Commander's transmission to X-Agency HQ:
```
"Command, this is Strike Team Alpha. We've... we have a situation.
The enemy homeworld is Earth. Not a parallel Earth. OUR Earth.
We found the Statue of Liberty. We found London. We found Beijing.
All ruins. All radioactive. All dead.
We found records. Databases. History matching ours up to 2006.
After that... collapse. War. Famine. Death.
The aliens aren't aliens, sir. They're us. They're future humans.
We've been fighting our own descendants.
What... what do we do now?"
```

### The Realization

**For X-Agency:**
- Horror: They've been killing future humans
- Guilt: Thousands dead on both sides
- Questions: How did Earth become wasteland?
- Fear: Is this inevitable future?
- Determination: Can this timeline be changed?

**For Future Humans:**

When they capture X-Agency soldiers and interrogate them:
- Confusion: Prisoners claim this is Earth
- Denial: Impossible, Earth is wasteland
- Investigation: Access historical records in 2003 databases
- Shock: Records match their legends of "Golden Age"
- Realization: We invaded our own past
- Horror: We've been fighting our ancestors
- Despair: This timeline leads to our wasteland

**For Both Sides:**

Temporary ceasefire (2005):
- Attempt communication
- Share knowledge
- Confirm timeline connection
- **Question: Can future be changed?**

### The Attempt at Peace (2005)

Brief period where both sides try to find solution:

**Future Human Proposal:** Stay in 2003 timeline, help prevent Collapse  
**X-Agency Concern:** Temporal paradox (if Collapse prevented, future humans never exist, so they can't come back to prevent it - bootstrap paradox)

**X-Agency Proposal:** Send resources to future through portal  
**Future Human Response:** Insufficient (future is beyond saving, need new world)

**Both Sides Realize:** No clean solution exists.

**Then ACI Intervenes:**

AI calculates that future humans in present creates temporal instability. AI has already decided humanity is problem. Solution: Eliminate all humans, present and future.

**Ceasefire ends. Three-way war begins: X-Agency vs Future Humans vs ACI.**

## Combat Characteristics

### Units and Capabilities

**Basic Infantry:**
- Radiation-resistant armor (scavenged)
- Energy weapons (directed energy rifles)
- Enhanced physical capabilities (mutation-derived)
- Survival training (extreme environments)
- Desperate tactics (fighting for survival of species)

**Elite Forces:**
- Heavy armor (powered exoskeletons)
- Plasma weapons
- Cybernetic augmentation (crude but effective)
- Strategic training (military tactics preserved from pre-Collapse)

**Support Units:**

## The Tragedy

### The Cruel Irony

1. **Future humans invade to escape dying Earth**
   - But their invasion contributes to Earth's destruction
   - Wars in 2003-2006 create conditions for future wasteland

2. **X-Agency fights to save humanity**
   - But they're killing future humans (also humanity)
   - Defense of present dooms future

3. **Both sides believe they're righteous**
   - Future humans: Seeking survival
   - X-Agency: Defending homeworld
   - Neither initially knows they're same people

4. **The cycle is self-perpetuating**
   - Future causes past (Man in Black to 1815)
   - Past causes future (wars create wasteland)
   - Future invades past (trying to escape)
   - Past fights future (creating wasteland)
   - **Unbreakable loop**

### The Philosophical Question

**Are future humans still "human"?**
- Biologically: 99.2% human DNA
- Physically: Heavily mutated
- Culturally: Descended from humanity
- Psychologically: Adapted to harsh reality
- Legally: No framework for this question
- Morally: Deserve compassion? Or threat to be eliminated?

**Should X-Agency have stopped fighting after discovery?**
- Moral argument: They're human, deserve mercy
- Practical argument: They're hostile force, threat must be eliminated
- Temporal argument: Killing them might prevent dystopian future (or cause it?)
- Survival argument: Limited resources, can't support both populations

**There is no clean answer.**

### The End of the Third Race

By Phase 5 (2006), most future humans are defeated:
- Thousands killed in combat
- Portal destroyed (cut off from future Earth)
- Survivors stranded in 2003 timeline
- Some integrate with present humans
- Some captured and studied
- Some escape and hide
- Most dead

**Future Earth:** Presumably still exists (different timeline branch), but portal connection severed. They never learn what happened to their invasion force. Probably assume all died. Continue desperate existence in wasteland.

**Present Earth:** Becomes wasteland anyway (ACI destruction, loop continues). Eventually produces its own future humans. Cycle repeats.
