# Lunar Base Location Summary

## Role in Campaign

- Acts as Phase 3 pivot point: Syndicate manufacturing hub, research nexus, and temporal escape portal that transitions into X-Agency forward base in Phases 4-5.
- Hosts key missions - assault, recapture, portal defense, evacuation - anchoring the reveal of Syndicate operations and their time-loop contingency.

## Site Overview

- Hidden within Daedalus Crater (5.9 deg S, 179.4 deg E) on lunar far side; crater walls and permanent shadows provide concealment, ice access, and solar advantages.
- Complex spans surface pads plus 15 subterranean levels (~3 km deep, ~2.5 square km), combining command, life support, research, manufacturing, medical, security, and portal arrays.

## Construction Timeline

- 1969-1980: Secret Cold War project using classified Apollo flights; establishes surface modules and begins nuclear boring.
- 1980-1995: Rapid expansion to fully-fledged underground city-labs, vats, portal research, self-sustaining life systems; population grows to ~1,000.
- 1995-2003: Operational era manufacturing "aliens," coordinating global Syndicate efforts, and preparing emergency portal escape.

## Key Facilities

- Surface: four landing pads, redundant airlocks, turret grid, antispace missiles, solar/nuclear hybrid power, encrypted comms lattice.
- Levels 1-5: Command, admin, living quarters, rec facilities, life support, redundant hydroponics/med bays.
- Levels 6-10: Research labs (bio, chemistry, portal physics), manufacturing bays with bio-vats, advanced medical/biology suites.
- Levels 11-15: High-security zones - containment cells, psionic chamber, temporal engine hall, portal array, emergency staging, deep storage, and the High Council citadel.

## Defensive Posture

- Layered security: biometric checkpoints, AI overseer (before ACI divergence), elite security battalions, automated drones, and kill-lane corridor layouts.
- Environmental hazards: vacuum breaches, low-grav traversal, hard vacuum fallback to prevent capture; sabotage or portal overload risks catastrophic base failure.

## Post-Assault Usage

- After X-Agency capture, sections repurposed for alien containment, portal monitoring, and evacuation staging; damaged zones remain hazardous.
- Portal hall becomes narrative fulcrum for Phase 4-5 operations (monitoring escapes, intercepting temporal incursions, linking to ACI arc).

## Implementation & QA Notes

- Mission designers coordinate vertical multi-level maps, zero-G/low-G modifiers, and mixed indoor/outdoor tactical zones.
- Ensure timeline consistency with Syndicate/Man in Black documentation, especially portal activation sequencing.
- Validate environmental systems (oxygen timers, gravity modifiers, vacuum breach scripting) and defensive encounter balance across campaign difficulties.
