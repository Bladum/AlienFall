# MIDI Integration Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated MIDI playback functionality into the AlienFall game engine. MIDI files have been moved from the separate `MIDI TEST` folder into the main engine assets directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Migration
- **Created directory**: `engine/assets/music/midi/`
- **Copied MIDI files**:
  - `Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.mid`
  - `random_song.mid`
  - `sample.mid`

### 2. Updated Files

#### Core Audio Manager
- **File**: `engine/core/audio_manager.lua`
- **Changes**: Updated `playMIDI()` to use integrated path `assets/music/midi/`

#### MIDI Player
- **File**: `engine/audio/midi_player.lua`  
- **Changes**: Removed absolute path conversion that was breaking Love2D filesystem access

#### MIDI Test Screens
- **Files**:
  - `engine/gui/scenes/midi_test_screen_fixed.lua`
  - `engine/gui/scenes/midi_test_screen.lua`
- **Changes**: Updated to scan `assets/music/midi/` directory

#### Main Menu
- **File**: `engine/gui/scenes/main_menu.lua`
- **Changes**: Updated TEST MIDI button to use new integrated paths

#### Debug/Test Utilities
- **Files**:
  - `engine/gui/scenes/debug_screen.lua`
  - `engine/simple_test.lua`
  - `engine/test_scan.lua`
- **Changes**: Updated all MIDI path references

### 3. Documentation
- **Created**: `engine/assets/music/midi/README.md`
- Documents usage, API, current files, and technical details

### 4. Cleanup
- **Removed**: `MIDI TEST/` folder (all files migrated)
- **Removed**: `sample.mid` from project root (duplicate)
- **Updated**: `create_simple_midi.lua` to generate files in new location

## Verification

✅ Game launches successfully
✅ MIDI files detected (3 files found)
✅ MIDI parser working (files parse correctly)
✅ Files accessible via Love2D filesystem
✅ All path references updated

## Test Output
```
[MidiTestScreen] Scanning for MIDI files...
[MidiTestScreen] Checking directory: assets/music/midi
[MidiTestScreen]   ✓ FOUND: assets/music/midi/Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.mid
[MidiTestScreen]   ✓ FOUND: assets/music/midi/random_song.mid
[MidiTestScreen]   ✓ FOUND: assets/music/midi/sample.mid
[MidiTestScreen] Total MIDI files found: 3
```

## Usage

### From Code
```lua
local AudioManager = require("core.audio_manager")

-- Play MIDI file (filename only, no path needed)
AudioManager:playMIDI("Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody")
AudioManager:playMIDI("random_song")
AudioManager:playMIDI("sample.mid")

-- Control playback
AudioManager:stopMIDI()
AudioManager:pauseMIDI()
AudioManager:resumeMIDI()
AudioManager:setMIDIVolume(0.6)
```

### From Game
1. Launch game: `lovec "engine"`
2. Use "MIDI Test" button from main menu
3. Or navigate to MIDI Test screen to browse and play files

## Next Steps

The MIDI system is now fully integrated. To add more MIDI files:
1. Simply copy `.mid` files to `engine/assets/music/midi/`
2. Files will be automatically discovered
3. Play using `AudioManager:playMIDI("filename")`

## Old MIDI TEST Folder

✅ **REMOVED** - The original `MIDI TEST/` folder has been deleted as all MIDI functionality is now integrated into the engine.

### Cleanup Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Removed `MIDI TEST/` folder and all contents
2. ✅ Removed `sample.mid` from project root (duplicate)
3. ✅ Updated `create_simple_midi.lua` to generate files in new location: `engine/assets/music/midi/`

All MIDI files and functionality are now properly integrated following the engine's asset organization standards.
