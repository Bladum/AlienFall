## Folder Inventory Breakdown

```
TOTAL DIRECTORIES: 249

├─ 60 folders      ✅ ACTIVE (legitimate code/content)
├─ 40 folders      ⚠️  DOCUMENTATION (README only)
├─ 20 folders      📁 ASSETS (staging, mostly empty)
├─ 15 folders      📦 PLACEHOLDERS (future features)
├─ 25 folders      🔧 SYSTEM (git, vscode, tools)
├─ 74 folders      ❌ MINIMAL (<=2 files, no subs)
└─ 15 folders      ✨ REDUNDANT (duplicates/overlaps)
```

## Cleanup Impact Assessment

```
PHASE 1: Delete (1 folder)
Effort: 1 min | Risk: 🟢 None | Impact: Clean

PHASE 2: Archive (3-5 folders)
Effort: 15 min | Risk: 🟢 Low | Impact: Clutter reduction

PHASE 3: Keep docs as-is (0 minutes)
Effort: 0 min | Risk: 🟢 None | Impact: No change

PHASE 4: Mark placeholders (20 minutes)
Effort: 20 min | Risk: 🟢 None | Impact: Clarity

TOTAL: ~40-60 minutes for significant improvement
```

## 🗂️ Folder Categories (by Status)

### GREEN - KEEP AS-IS ✅ (~60 folders)
```
engine/core/*                 - Core systems (proper)
engine/battlescape/*          - Combat system (well organized)
engine/geoscape/*             - Strategic layer (comprehensive)
engine/basescape/*            - Base management (solid)
engine/economy/*              - Economic systems (good)
engine/politics/*             - Political systems (good)
engine/content/*              - Game content (organized)
engine/gui/widgets/*          - UI framework (proper)
api/*                         - API documentation (correct place)
architecture/*                - Architecture docs (good)
mods/core/rules/*             - Active game content (necessary)
tests/unit, battle, etc.      - Test suites (proper)
```

### YELLOW - REVIEW & MARK ⚠️ (~40 folders)
```
engine/ai/diplomacy/          - Document as placeholder
engine/basescape/data/        - Clarify purpose
engine/geoscape/data/         - Clarify purpose
engine/assets/fonts/          - Expected content
engine/assets/sounds/         - Expected content
engine/lore/events/           - Consolidate or clarify

(Many README-only folders - needs status labels)
```

### RED - CONSOLIDATE/ARCHIVE 🔴 (~20 folders)
```
tests/framework/ui_testing/   - Merge into tests/framework/
engine/portal/                - Archive (not implemented)
engine/network/               - Archive (not implemented)
(Keep docs/ folder as-is - intentional structure)
```

### ORANGE - DELETE 🗑️ (1 folder)
```
tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/   - Completely empty
```

---

## 📊 Size & Complexity

### Directory Depth Analysis
```
Max depth: 8 levels (tools/spritesheet_generator/armies/blue/graphics/)
Average depth: 3-4 levels

Acceptable nesting for:
- tools/spritesheet_generator/  (complex structure)
- engine/battlescape/           (well organized)
- mods/core/                    (necessary hierarchy)
```

### File Distribution
```
Empty folders:              1 (delete)
Minimal folders (<5 files):  40 (review)
Small folders (5-10 files):  50 (okay)
Medium folders (10-50):      80 (good)
Large folders (50+):         60 (watch for monoliths)
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Actions (Prioritized)

### MUST DO (Risk: None)
```
1. Delete tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
   Time: 1 min | Risk: None

2. Mark placeholder folders with [PLACEHOLDER] status
   Time: 20 min | Risk: None
   Doc-only, no code changes
```

### SHOULD DO (Risk: Low)
```
3. Archive engine/network/ and engine/portal/
   Time: 10 min | Risk: Low
   Mark or move to separate _FUTURE folder

4. Keep docs/ folder as-is
   Time: 0 min | Risk: None
   Intentional separation from api/
```

### NICE TO DO (Risk: Medium)
```
5. Merge test frameworks into single location
   Time: 20 min | Risk: Medium
   Requires test import updates
```

### OPTIONAL (Risk: Higher)
```
6. Establish documentation governance rules
   Time: 1 hour | Risk: Medium
   Create policy for future folder creation
```

## ✅ POSITIVE STRUCTURES

**Good Examples:**

1. **engine/battlescape/** - Clear organization
   ```
   battlescape/
   ├─ ai/              (combat AI)
   ├─ battle/          (battle logic)
   ├─ battlefield/     (map/terrain)
   ├─ combat/          (combat mechanics)
   ├─ managers/        (entity management)
   └─ ui/              (combat UI)
   ```

2. **mods/core/rules/** - Proper content structure
   ```
   rules/
   ├─ units/           (unit definitions)
   ├─ crafts/          (craft definitions)
   ├─ items/           (item definitions)
   └─ missions/        (mission definitions)
   ```

3. **engine/content/** - Parallel to mods
   ```
   content/
   ├─ units/           (unit content)
   ├─ crafts/          (craft content)
   ├─ items/           (item content)
   └─ missions/        (mission content)
   ```

## 📈 Expected Improvements (After Cleanup)

### Current State
```
- 249 directories (bloated)
- 74 minimal folders (confusing)
- 40 README-only (unclear purpose)
- Scattered documentation (hard to maintain)
- Multiple parallel hierarchies (redundant)
Quality: 6.5/10
```

### After Phase 1-2-4 Cleanup
```
- 245 directories (-0.2%)
- 20 minimal folders (-75%)
- 40+ README-only (all marked clearly)
- Clearer placeholder identification
- Better structure clarity
Quality: 7.5/10
```

## 📞 Questions to Ask Before Cleanup

1. **Are any of these folders actively used?**
   - Check git blame for recent commits
   - Check for imports/requires from other code

2. **Do any external tools/scripts reference these paths?**
   - Search build scripts
   - Check GitHub CI/CD configs
   - Search tool configurations

3. **Which team members own which systems?**
   - Avoid breaking active development
   - Coordinate consolidations

4. **What's the preferred documentation strategy?**
   - Keep docs/ separate from api/?
   - Or different approach?
