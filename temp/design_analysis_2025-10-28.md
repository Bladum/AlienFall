4. Generate TOML patch file
5. Apply to `mods/core/rules/` files
6. Log adjustment for transparency
7. Re-run simulation to verify

**Auto-Balance Logic**:
```python
def auto_balance_kpi(kpi, actual_value):
    """
    Automatically adjust game parameters based on KPI failure.
    
    Example: Rifle overused (60% usage, target 40%)
    - Delta: +20% (overused)
    - Action: Reduce rifle accuracy by 5%
    - Formula: rifle_accuracy * (1 - 0.05) = 75 * 0.95 = 71.25 → 71
    """
    if kpi.status == "FAIL" and kpi.auto_adjust:
        delta = actual_value - kpi.target_value
        direction = -1 if delta > 0 else 1  # Opposite direction to correct
        adjustment = kpi.adjustment_factor * direction
        
        # Read current TOML value
        current = read_toml_value(kpi.adjustment_target)
        
        # Calculate new value
        new_value = round(current * (1 + adjustment))
        
        # Validate bounds (don't exceed min/max)
        new_value = clamp(new_value, kpi.min_value, kpi.max_value)
        
        # Generate patch
        patch = {
            "file": kpi.toml_file,
            "field": kpi.adjustment_target,
            "old_value": current,
            "new_value": new_value,
            "reason": f"{kpi.name} failed: {actual_value} vs target {kpi.target_value}",
            "timestamp": now()
        }
        
        return patch
```

## 5. Glossary Update Requirements

### New Terms to Add

#### Analytics Section (New)
```markdown
## ANALYTICS & AUTO-BALANCE (System Intelligence Layer)

### Core Analytics Concepts

- **Analytics System**: Comprehensive data pipeline collecting, processing, and analyzing gameplay data to validate balance, optimize performance, and guide design decisions.
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: Quantifiable metric measuring specific game quality dimension; defines success criteria for design goals (e.g., combat balance variance, FPS performance).
- **Metric**: Quantifiable measurement derived from gameplay data; answers specific design question through SQL aggregation.
- **Auto-Balance**: Automated system adjusting game parameters (TOML values) based on analytics data to maintain target balance metrics without manual intervention.
- **Simulation**: Autonomous game instance running AI-controlled factions and players to generate analytics data; operates headlessly in background.
- **Player AI**: Separate meta-AI making strategic decisions mimicking human behavior; generates synthetic gameplay data for analytics.
- **Faction AI**: Native game AI executing enemy strategy; plays opponent role in simulations and live games.

### Data Infrastructure

- **Parquet**: Columnar file format for storing structured analytics data; enables rapid SQL queries on large datasets without full database overhead.
- **DuckDB**: Embedded SQL database engine for analytics queries; processes Parquet files directly without external server or configuration.
- **JSON-Lines (JSONL)**: Streaming log format where each line is independent JSON object; enables real-time log aggregation and processing.
- **Log Rotation**: Automated process of archiving old logs and starting new files; typically hourly or daily to maintain manageable file sizes.
- **Schema Validation**: Process of verifying log records match expected structure; rejects malformed data to maintain data quality.

### Metrics & Measurement

- **Target Value**: Ideal measurement for KPI indicating perfect game balance (e.g., 60 FPS, 50% win rate, 0 budget deficit).
- **Threshold**: Acceptable deviation from target value; defines when metric transitions between PASS/WARN/FAIL states.
- **Variance**: Statistical measure of spread in data; high variance indicates inconsistent experience (e.g., unit win rates 30-70% = high variance).
- **P95 (95th Percentile)**: Statistical measure where 95% of samples fall below value; used for performance metrics to ignore outliers.
- **Trend**: Direction of metric change over time (IMPROVING, STABLE, REGRESSING); calculated from historical KPI data.

### Auto-Balance Mechanics

- **Adjustment Factor**: Percentage change applied to TOML value when KPI fails (typically 5-10%); smaller = gradual tuning, larger = aggressive correction.
- **Adjustment Target**: Specific TOML field modified by auto-balance (e.g., weapon_accuracy, enemy_hp, research_cost).
- **Balance Patch**: TOML file modification generated by auto-balance system; includes old value, new value, reason, and timestamp.
- **A/B Testing**: Technique deploying balance changes to subset of simulations; compares outcomes before full rollout.
- **Cascading Effects**: Secondary metric changes resulting from single balance adjustment; requires multi-metric impact analysis.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous cycle of data collection → metric calculation → balance adjustment → verification → repeat.

### Data Analysis

- **Aggregation**: SQL operation combining multiple records into summary statistics (AVG, SUM, COUNT, PERCENTILE).
- **Filtering**: SQL WHERE clause limiting analysis to specific conditions (e.g., only missions after month 3).
- **Segmentation**: Grouping data by category (unit class, weapon type, difficulty) to identify sub-patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical technique identifying relationships between metrics (e.g., research speed affects campaign completion rate).
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying data points far from normal range; may indicate bugs or edge cases.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Drilling down from failed metric to underlying factors causing failure.
```

#### Morale/Bravery/Sanity Section (Expand existing)
```markdown
### Psychological Warfare (Expand existing section)

- **Bravery**: Core unit stat (6-12 range) determining morale capacity in battle; higher bravery = larger morale pool and better panic resistance. Increases with experience (+1 per 3 ranks) and traits (Brave +2, Fearless +3).
- **Morale**: In-battle psychological state starting at Bravery value and degrading from stress (ally deaths, damage, flanking); drops to 0 trigger PANIC (all AP lost). Recoverable via Rest action (2 AP → +1) or Leader rally (4 AP → +2). Resets to Bravery after mission.
- **Sanity**: Long-term mental stability (6-12 range) that persists between missions; drops after missions based on horror level (Standard 0, Moderate -1, Hard -2, Horror -3). Recovers slowly (+1/week base, +2/week with Temple). At 0 sanity, unit cannot deploy (Broken state).
- **Panic**: Combat state triggered when morale reaches 0; unit loses all remaining AP and cannot perform actions until morale recovered through rest or rally.
- **Broken (Sanity)**: Permanent unit state when sanity reaches 0; unit cannot be deployed until sanity recovered through facilities or special treatment.
- **Horror Level**: Mission classification determining sanity damage (Standard 0, Moderate -1, Hard -2, Horror -3); higher horror = greater psychological impact.
```

#### Pilot & Interception Section (Expand existing)
```markdown
### Interception & Pilots (Expand existing section)

- **Pilot**: Specialized unit class operating craft in interception combat; gains experience and abilities separate from ground combat units. Pilots have unique stats (Reflexes, Accuracy, Nerves) and promotion paths.
- **Ace Pilot**: Elite pilot rank achieved after 5+ confirmed UFO kills; grants combat bonuses (+10% accuracy, +2 energy per turn) and unlocks special maneuvers.
- **Deck (Interception)**: Collection of maneuver cards available to pilot during air combat; customizable based on craft type, pilot skills, and equipment loadout. Deck size typically 15-20 cards.
- **Card (Interception)**: Individual maneuver or ability usable in air combat; costs energy and action points. Cards include offensive (missiles, guns), defensive (evasion, shields), and utility (scan, repair) types.
- **Energy (Interception)**: Resource generated each turn (base 3-5, affected by pilot/craft) used to play cards; unspent energy does not carry over.
- **Dogfight**: Active air combat engagement between player craft and UFO; resolved through turn-based card combat system similar to Magic: The Gathering.
```

## 10. Additional Improvement Ideas

### Auto-Balance Enhancements

#### A. Predictive Balance
**Concept**: Use machine learning to predict future balance issues

**Implementation**:
- Train ML model on historical KPI data
- Predict: "If current trend continues, weapon X will be overused in 2 weeks"
- Pre-emptive adjustment before problem becomes severe
- **Tools**: Python scikit-learn, TensorFlow

#### B. Multi-Objective Optimization
**Concept**: Balance competing KPIs simultaneously

**Problem**: Buffing enemy HP improves difficulty but hurts mission pacing
**Solution**: Optimize multiple objectives:
- Maximize: Difficulty balance (50% win rate)
- Minimize: Mission duration variance
- Constraint: Mission time < 30 minutes average

**Tools**: Python scipy.optimize, genetic algorithms

#### C. Community Voting on Balance
**Concept**: Let players vote on proposed auto-balance changes

**Flow**:
1. Auto-balance detects rifle overused (60% usage)
2. Proposes: "Reduce rifle accuracy 75 → 71"
3. Posts to in-game bulletin: "Vote on balance change"
4. Players vote: Accept / Reject / Suggest Alternative
5. If 60%+ accept: Apply change
6. If reject: Try different adjustment

**Benefit**: Community engagement + transparency

#### D. Faction-Specific Balance
**Concept**: Balance differs by faction (Sectoids vs Ethereals)

**Example**:
- Sectoids: 55% win rate (too strong)
- Ethereals: 45% win rate (too weak)
- Auto-balance: Reduce Sectoid HP, increase Ethereal abilities
- Verify: Both factions now 50% win rate

#### E. Difficulty-Specific Balance
**Concept**: Auto-balance per difficulty tier

**Example**:
- Easy: 80% win rate (too easy) → Increase enemy count
- Normal: 55% win rate (good) → No change
- Hard: 25% win rate (too hard) → Reduce enemy HP
