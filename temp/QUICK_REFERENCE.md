# Quick Reference: What Changed

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**TL;DR**: All design documentation problems fixed. 3 new technical spec files created. 50+ future opportunities documented.

---

## ⚡ Quick Summary

### Problems Fixed ✅
1. **Pilot System Contradiction** → Aligned to "pilots as separate units" model
2. **Redundant Craft Files** → Craft.md deleted, Crafts.md is authoritative
3. **Scattered Relationship Mechanics** → Consolidated in DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md

### New Files Created ✨
1. **PilotSystem_Technical.md** - Complete pilot mechanics
2. **DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md** - Universal relationship system
3. **FutureOpportunities.md** - 50+ feature proposals in 10 categories

### Files Updated 📝
- Crafts.md - Pilot system aligned
- Units.md - Cross-reference added
- Politics.md - Cross-reference added
- Countries.md - Cross-reference added

### Files Removed 🗑️
- Craft.md - Redundant (merged into Crafts.md)

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Pilots: Separate Units (Not Craft-Integrated)
**Why?** More tactical depth, better storytelling, aligns with XCOM inspiration.

**Mechanics**:
- Pilots can be assigned to crafts OR deployed to battlescape
- Dual XP tracks: Pilot XP (interception) + Ground XP (battlescape)
- If pilot dies in crash, craft needs new pilot
- Strategic tension: Use best pilot where? Craft or ground?

### Relationships: Universal -100 to +100 Scale
**Why?** Consistency, easier balancing, cross-entity comparisons.

**Applies To**:
- Countries (funding based on relation)
- Suppliers (pricing based on relation)
- Alien Factions (hostility based on relation)

## 🚀 Top Priorities from FutureOpportunities.md

### 1. Mid-Game Campaign Events 🔥 HIGHEST
**Problem**: Months 4-6 can feel repetitive.  
**Solution**: Dynamic plot twists (political coups, alien civil wars, scientific breakthroughs).  
**Impact**: Retention, unpredictability, excitement.

### 2. Advanced Unit Psychology 🔥 HIGH
**Feature**: Personality matrix (brave, cautious, bloodthirsty), bond system, morale cascades.  
**Impact**: Emotional investment, emergent storytelling, player attachment.

### 3. Strategic Meta-Objectives 🔥 MEDIUM-HIGH
**Feature**: Divergent victory paths (tech supremacy, diplomacy, military domination, shadow conspiracy).  
**Impact**: Replayability, player agency, multiple endings.

### 4. Seasonal Weather System 🌦️ MEDIUM
**Feature**: Weather affects tactics (winter = reduced vision, summer = heat exhaustion).  
**Impact**: Tactical variety, immersion, strategic planning.
