## 🎯 Top 5 Critical Actions (This Week)

### 1. Fix Test Runner 🔴
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**File:** `tests2/main.lua`  
**Solution:** Use `love.filesystem` instead of `require()` for dynamic test loading

**Why Critical:** Blocks all test execution, prevents quality validation

**Effort:** 8-12 hours  
**File:** `design/mechanics/Balance_Values.xlsx`  
**Contents:** Unit stats, facility costs, equipment costs, research costs, mission rewards

**Why Critical:** Many design docs have "TBD" values, blocks final tuning

---

### 3. Resolve Critical Lore Gaps 🔴
**Status:** 35 gaps identified, 5 critical  
**Effort:** 20-25 hours (critical only)  
**Files:** `lore/story/phase_3.md`, `lore/story/factions.md`, all phase files

**Critical Gaps:**
- Portal Mechanics (8-10h)
- Syndicate Leadership (4-6h)
- X-Agency Leader Names (9-12h)

**Why Critical:** Blocks campaign event system implementation

---

### 4. Complete M3 Basescape UI 🟡
**Status:** 70% COMPLETE  
**Effort:** 40-60 hours  
**Deadline:** January 31, 2026  
**Remaining:** Research panel, Manufacturing panel, Personnel management

**Why Critical:** M3 milestone depends on this

---

### 5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline 🟢
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Benefits:** Catch bugs before merge, prevent regressions, build confidence

**Why Important:** Establishes quality gates for all future development
