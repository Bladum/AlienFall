## Usage Notes

### For AI Art Generation

1. **Copy prompt exactly** or customize with specific details
2. **Add style modifiers** like "unreal engine", "octane render", "trending on artstation"
3. **Adjust aspect ratios** for different uses (16:9 for concept art, 9:16 for character portraits)
4. **Generate multiple variations** and select best
5. **Iterate** by adding details or changing specific elements

### For Human Artists

- Use prompts as **reference descriptions**
- Combine elements from multiple prompts
- Add personal style interpretation
- Focus on **emotional core** described
- Consider **narrative context** from lore documents

### For Game Implementation

- Generate consistent art for **faction identity**
- Create **before/after comparisons** (Earth present vs future)
- Design **UI elements** matching tone
- Develop **loading screens** showing key events
- Build **cutscene storyboards** from event prompts
