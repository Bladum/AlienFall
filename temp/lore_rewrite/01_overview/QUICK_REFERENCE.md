## üéØ Core Concept (30 Seconds)

**AlienFall is about a time loop.** Future creates past. Past creates future. No escape.

- **1815:** Time travelers from 2003 arrive, manipulate history
- **1996-2006:** Wars and alien invasions (the player's campaign)
- **2003:** Time travelers escape to 1815 (loop closes)
- **2200s:** Future humans (mutated) invade their own past
- **2006:** AI betrays humanity, Earth collapses, timeline resets
- **Loop:** Repeats eternally

**Theme:** Pyrrhic victory. Saving humanity requires destroying everything.
