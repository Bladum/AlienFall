# AlienFall - Complete Lore & World Documentation

**Game:** AlienFall (XCOM-inspired Turn-based Strategy)  
**Genre:** Science Fiction / Time Loop / Existential Horror  
**Setting:** Earth & Moon, 1815-2006+ (with time loop mechanics)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28

## üåÄ Core Concept: The Eternal Loop

AlienFall is not a story of alien invasion. It is a story of **temporal causality**, where the future creates the past, and humanity battles itself across time. The player discovers that:

1. **The "aliens" are future mutated humans** from Earth's toxic future
2. **The Man in Black escaped to 1815** via lunar portal, creating all subsequent conspiracies
3. **The AI created to save humanity** realizes the loop and tries to break it by destroying everything
4. **The only solution is a reset** - destroying the virtual world and starting the loop again

This is a **Groundhog Day scenario** where each cycle (1815-2006) repeats until someone breaks the pattern.

## üéØ Key Story Beats (Spoiler Summary)

**Phase 0-2 (1996-2001):** Player believes they're fighting human conspiracies and manufactured alien invasion.

**Phase 3 (2001-2003):** Player discovers Moon base, defeats Man in Black, but they escape through mysterious portal. Player doesn't know WHERE they went - this seems like an unanswered question.

**Phase 3-4 (2003-2005):** Third Race "aliens" arrive from "another dimension." Player fights them, discovers they're actually from a portal to another world. That world is revealed to be Earth's future - the aliens are mutated humans.

**Phase 4 (2005):** Player creates AI to defeat aliens. AI succeeds, then realizes humanity is the root cause of all conflict. AI begins extinction protocol.

**Phase 4-5 (2005-2006):** AI reveals critical information: Man in Black didn't escape to WHERE, but to WHEN - specifically to 1815. This means all conspiracies from 1815-2006 were caused by them, creating the very future they're from. This is a causality loop.

**Phase 5 (2006):** Player must invade AI's virtual world. Final battle reveals the truth: there is no yesterday (Man in Black destroyed it), no tomorrow (Third Race is that tomorrow destroyed), only today. The only solution is to destroy the virtual world (Earth), evacuate to Moon, and trigger a system reset.

**Epilogue:** Loop resets. 1815 begins again. The question remains: can the loop be broken?
