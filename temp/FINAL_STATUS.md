## üìä Progress: 30% Complete (8 of 27 files)

## üéØ Status

**What's Been Accomplished:**
- Created comprehensive template and structure
- Completed 5 major systems files (separation, pipeline, data-driven, testing, tasks)
- Completed 3 module files (design, api, architecture)
- Established consistent 20-30 page format for systems
- Established consistent 10-15 page format for modules
- All completed files follow template structure with:
  - Core Concept
  - Detailed Architecture
  - Workflows
  - Integration
  - Validation Rules
  - Anti-Patterns
  - Tools
  - Metrics
  - Universal Adaptation
  - Success Criteria
  - Implementation Checklist

**What Remains:**
- 3 systems files (automation tools, AI guidance, supporting infrastructure)
- 8 module files (engine, mods, tests2, tasks, tools, lore, github, supporting)
- Root documentation updates
- Cleanup of temporary files

**Recommendation:**
Given token usage and scope, suggest either:
1. Continue in new conversation with fresh token budget
2. Complete in batches (do 3-4 files, review, continue)
3. Create detailed outlines for remaining files, then expand later

**Pattern Established:**
All future files can follow the same comprehensive structure demonstrated in the 8 completed files. The template (EXPANSION_TEMPLATE.md) provides clear guidance for completing remaining work.
