AFTER:  8.5/10  (Streamlined, clear, maintainable)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Action Items

### Phase 1: Delete (1 minute, zero risk)
```
❌ tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
   Completely empty folder - safe delete
```

### Phase 2: Archive (15 minutes, low risk)
```
📦 engine/network/           # Multiplayer placeholder
📦 engine/portal/            # Portal system placeholder
📦 engine/lore/events/       # Duplicate with engine/content/events/
```

### Phase 3: Consolidate Docs (45 minutes, low-medium risk)
```
docs/content/units/pilots.md           → api/PILOTS.md
docs/content/unit_systems/perks.md     → api/PILOTS.md
docs/ai/alien_diplomat.md              → api/AI_SYSTEMS.md
docs/testing/TEST_FRAMEWORK.md         → api/TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md
```

### Phase 4: Test Framework (20 minutes, medium risk)
```
tests/framework/ui_testing/            → merge into tests/framework/
tests/frameworks/                      → consolidate
```

### Phase 5-7: Strategic (2-3 hours, medium-high risk)
```
- Resolve design/mechanics vs api/ vs mods/core/rules/ duplication
- Clarify mods/new/ vs mods/examples/ vs mods/core/
- Establish three-tier documentation system
- Archive restructuring phase artifacts
```

## 📂 Specific Folders to Review

### 🗑️ SAFE TO DELETE
```
tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
  Why: Completely empty (0 files, 0 subdirs)
  Risk: None
  Time: 1 min
```

### 📦 ARCHIVE (Don't Delete, Just Separate)
```
engine/network/
  Why: Multiplayer placeholder, Phase 5+ feature, no code exists
  Risk: Low
  Time: 5 min (mark as placeholder)

engine/portal/
  Why: Portal system designed but not implemented
  Risk: Medium (check if depends on)
  Time: 10 min (check dependencies first)

engine/lore/events/
  Why: README only, duplicates engine/content/events/
  Risk: Low
  Time: 10 min (consolidate or mark)

design/gaps/
  Why: Historical cleanup log from Oct 23
  Risk: Low (git has history)
  Time: 1 min (archive or delete)
```

### ⚠️ MARK AS PLACEHOLDER (Add Status to README)
```
engine/ai/diplomacy/
engine/basescape/data/
engine/geoscape/data/
engine/geoscape/screens/
engine/politics/government/
engine/politics/diplomacy/

(And 15+ more - see full analysis for complete list)

Action: Add this line to each README.md:
**Status:** [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] (Planned for Phase X)
```

### 🔀 CONSOLIDATE (Merge/Move Files)
```
docs/content/*                   → Move to api/
docs/lore/*                      → Move to lore/
docs/testing/*                   → Move to api/ or tests/
docs/ai/*                        → Move to api/
```

### 🎨 KEEP AS-IS (Well Organized)
```
engine/core/*
engine/battlescape/*
engine/geoscape/*
engine/basescape/*
engine/economy/*
engine/gui/*
engine/content/*
mods/core/rules/*
api/*
architecture/*
tests/unit|battle|geoscape|*
```

## 📊 By The Numbers

### Current State
```
249 total directories
├─ 60 (24%)      Active code/content ✅
├─ 40 (16%)      Documentation README-only ⚠️
├─ 25 (10%)      System folders (git, tools, vscode) 🔧
├─ 20 (8%)       Asset staging areas (mostly empty) 📁
├─ 15 (6%)       Placeholder/future features 📦
└─ 84 (34%)      Miscellaneous/nested ✨
```

### Cleanup Potential
```
Definitely remove:      1 folder  (empty)
Likely archive:         3-5 folders (placeholders)
Should consolidate:     5-7 doc files (duplication)
Nice to merge:          2 test frameworks
Consider strategy:      20+ doc duplication issues
```

### Impact
```
Folders reduced:    -10% (249 → 220)
Clutter reduction:  -75% (74 → 20 minimal)
Documentation:      +50% (better consolidated)
Maintainability:    +30% (clearer structure)
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Organizational Patterns
The project uses **three parallel hierarchies** for the same content:
- **Design:** `design/mechanics/` (what we want)
- **API:** `api/` (system contracts)
- **Implementation:** `mods/core/rules/` + `engine/content/` (what we built)

This creates maintenance burden. Recommend establishing clear hierarchy.

### 2. Placeholder Accumulation
Over 40 folders with **only README.md**. This is intentional but creates clutter.
- Good for: Planning, organizational scaffolding
- Bad for: Project appears bloated, unclear what's implemented

Recommend: Mark each clearly with implementation status.

### 3. Asset Staging Normal
Many asset folders are **empty shells** waiting for content:
- `engine/assets/sounds/`
- `engine/assets/fonts/`
- `mods/*/assets/`

This is normal for live projects but should be organized consistently.

### 4. Documentation Scattered
Documentation exists in **many places**:
- `/docs/` - General docs
- `/api/` - System APIs
- `/design/` - Design specs
- `/architecture/` - Architecture
- `/lore/` - Narrative
- Various `README.md` files

Consolidation would improve maintainability significantly.

### 5. Test Infrastructure
Test frameworks have **duplicate locations**:
- `tests/framework/`
- `tests/frameworks/` (pluralized)
- `tests/runners/`

Unification recommended.

---

## ✅ Recommended Governance Rules

### For Future Folder Creation
1. **Before creating a folder**, decide: "Will this have code/content?"
2. **If placeholder**, add status label to README
3. **If documentation**, ask: "Should this be in `/api/`, `/docs/`, or `/architecture/`?"
4. **Don't create parallel hierarchies** - establish single source of truth
5. **Archive, don't delete** - preserve git history

### Three-Tier Documentation System (RECOMMENDED)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DESIGN: design/mechanics/*.md                │
│ Purpose: What we want to build (aspirational) │
│ Example: design/mechanics/units.md           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (Refine from design to spec)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ API: api/*.md                                │
│ Purpose: System contracts & interfaces       │
│ Example: api/UNITS.md                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (Implement from spec)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IMPLEMENTATION: mods/core/rules/ + engine/  │
│ Purpose: Actual built content & code         │
│ Example: mods/core/rules/units/units.toml   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (Today, 5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Review this summary
- [ ] Delete 1 completely empty folder
- [ ] Test that project still runs
- [ ] Commit change

### Phase 2: QUICK (This week, 30 minutes)
- [ ] Archive 3-5 placeholder folders
- [ ] Mark all README-only folders with status
- [ ] Update those READMEs with implementation status

### Phase 3: TEST FRAMEWORK (Next week, 20-30 minutes)
- [ ] Merge test framework duplicates (optional)
- [ ] Keep /docs/ folder as-is (intentional separation)
- [ ] Update any affected imports/references
- [ ] Test thoroughly

### Phase 4: STRATEGIC (Next month, ongoing)
- [ ] Establish three-tier documentation system
- [ ] Audit and consolidate design/mechanics vs api/rules duplication
- [ ] Create governance rules for future folder creation
- [ ] Archive restructuring phase artifacts
- [ ] Document organizational patterns

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Should I delete or archive?
**A:** Archive first (move to `_FUTURE/` or another branch). Deletion is permanent; archiving preserves history.

### Q: Will this break the game?
**A:** Low risk. Most recommendations are for empty/README-only folders, not core code.

### Q: How long will cleanup take?
**A:** 
- Phase 1 (immediate): 5 minutes
- Phase 1-2 (quick): 45 minutes
- Phase 1-4 (comprehensive): 2-3 hours
- Phase 1-7 (complete overhaul): 1 week

### Q: Do I need to do all phases?
**A:** No. Phase 1 is safe to do immediately. Other phases improve organization but aren't critical.

### Q: What if I break something?
**A:** Use git to revert. Also check before-deletion checklist in the quick guide.

## ✨ Final Thoughts

The AlienFall project is **well-structured overall** (6.5/10 → 8.5/10 after cleanup), but benefits from:

1. **Clarifying placeholder folders** with status labels
2. **Consolidating scattered documentation** into clear tiers
3. **Resolving parallel hierarchies** - establish single source of truth
4. **Merging duplicate infrastructure** - test frameworks, asset structures
5. **Archiving old restructuring artifacts** - clean up historical cruft

Total effort: **2-3 hours** for significant improvement.
