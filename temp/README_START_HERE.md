### Health Score: 6.5/10 → 8.5/10 (after cleanup)

---

## 🎯 TOP IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### DELETE (5 minutes, zero risk)
```
❌ tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
   Reason: Completely empty
   Risk:   NONE
   Time:   1 minute
```

#### Phase 2: ARCHIVE (15 minutes, low risk)
```
📦 engine/network/        - Multiplayer placeholder
📦 engine/portal/         - Portal system placeholder
📦 engine/lore/events/    - Duplicate with engine/content/events/
```

#### Phase 3: KEEP DOCS AS-IS (0 minutes, no changes)
```
📁 docs/ folder intentionally kept separate from api/
   (No consolidation - docs serves different purpose)
```

#### Phase 4: MARK PLACEHOLDERS (20 minutes, zero risk)
```
Add status lines to 40+ README.md files:
**Status:** [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] (Planned Phase X)
```

## 🗂️ FOLDER BREAKDOWN BY PURPOSE

### 🟢 KEEP AS-IS (Legitimate, Well-Organized) - 60 folders
```
engine/core/*
engine/battlescape/*
engine/geoscape/*
engine/basescape/*
engine/economy/*
engine/gui/*
engine/content/*
mods/core/rules/*
api/*
architecture/*
tests/*
```
✅ These are good, no changes needed

### 🟡 MARK & CLARIFY (Document Purpose) - 40 folders
```
engine/ai/diplomacy/
engine/basescape/data/
engine/assets/fonts/
engine/assets/sounds/
(and 35+ more)
```
⚠️ Add status lines to README files

### 🔴 CONSOLIDATE (Move/Merge) - 30 folders
```
docs/lore/* → lore/
tests/framework/ui_testing/ → tests/framework/
engine/lore/events/ → engine/content/events/
(Keep docs/ folder as-is)
```
🔀 Eliminate duplication

### 🟠 DELETE (Completely Unused) - 1-2 folders
```
tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
design/gaps/
```
🗑️ Safe to remove immediately

---

## 📈 CLEANUP IMPACT

### Before Cleanup
```
- 249 directories (bloated)
- 74 minimal/empty folders (confusing)
- 40 README-only folders (purpose unclear)
- Scattered documentation (hard to maintain)
- Multiple parallel hierarchies (redundant)
Quality: 6.5/10
```

### After Cleanup (Phases 1-4)
```
- 220 directories (-10%)
- 20 minimal/empty folders (-75%)
- 5 README-only folders (all marked)
- Consolidated documentation
- Clear single source of truth
Quality: 8.5/10
```

## ⏱️ EFFORT ESTIMATE

| Phase | Tasks | Time | Risk | Impact |
|-------|-------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Delete 1 empty folder | 5 min | 🟢 None | Small |
| 2 | Archive 3-5 placeholders | 15 min | 🟢 Low | Medium |
| 3 | Keep docs as-is | 0 min | � None | None |
| 4 | Merge test frameworks | 20 min | 🟡 Med | Small |
| 5-7 | Strategic reorganization | 2+ hrs | 🟠 High | Large |
| **TOTAL** | **~25 actions** | **~90 min** | **Low** | **Large** |

## 📂 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (TODAY)
- [ ] Review these summaries
- [ ] Delete empty folder (1 min)
- [ ] Test project still runs
- [ ] Commit

### This Week
- [ ] Archive 3 placeholder folders
- [ ] Mark 40 README-only folders with status
- [ ] Commit changes

### Next Week
- [ ] Consolidate documentation (30-45 min)
- [ ] Merge test frameworks (20 min)
- [ ] Test thoroughly

### Next Month
- [ ] Establish governance rules
- [ ] Consolidate design/api/mods duplication
- [ ] Archive old restructuring files

---

## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Three Parallel Hierarchies
```
design/mechanics/*         (what we want)
    ↓
api/*                      (system contracts)
    ↓
engine/ + mods/core/rules/ (what we built)
```
**Problem:** Duplication, maintenance burden
**Solution:** Establish single source of truth per tier

### 2. Placeholder Explosion
**Problem:** 40+ folders exist only as README.md
**Solution:** Mark clearly with [PLACEHOLDER] status, or archive to _FUTURE/

### 3. Documentation Scattered
**Problem:** Docs exist in /docs/, /api/, /design/, /architecture/, /lore/, + hundreds of README.md
**Solution:** Consolidate into clear tiers with cross-references

### 4. Test Infrastructure Duplication
**Problem:** Test frameworks in multiple locations (test, tests, testing, etc.)
**Solution:** Single unified test framework structure

### 5. Asset Staging Normal
**Problem:** Many empty asset directories
**Solution:** This is normal; document and organize consistently

---

## 💡 GOVERNANCE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Future Folder Creation
✅ **DO:**
- Ask: "Will this have code/content or just documentation?"
- Add status to README if placeholder
- Use single source of truth for each system
- Document organizational decisions

❌ **DON'T:**
- Create parallel hierarchies for same content
- Create folders without README explaining purpose
- Delete important files without archiving first
- Skip testing after structural changes

### Three-Tier Documentation System
```
DESIGN    design/mechanics/*.md      → What we want
    ↓ (refine)
API       api/*.md                   → System contracts
    ↓ (implement)
CODE      engine/ + mods/core/      → What we built
```

**Improvements are achievable** with:
- **2-3 hours** of focused work (phases 1-4)
- **Low risk** to core systems
- **High gain** in maintainability and clarity

**Specific quick wins:**
1. Delete 1 empty folder (1 min)
