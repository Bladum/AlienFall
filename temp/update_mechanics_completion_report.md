> **Date**: 2025-10-28  
> **Systems Updated**: Black Market + Morale/Bravery/Sanity  
> **Workflow**: Followed `.github/prompts/update_mechanics.prompt.md`  
> **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Workflow Followed

Following the update_mechanics prompt, I systematically checked and updated all relevant files across the Design → API → Architecture → Engine → Mods → Tests → Docs layers.

---

## 1. DESIGN LAYER ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Created
1. **`design/mechanics/BlackMarket.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete Black Market system specification
   - 6 purchase categories documented
   - Mission generation, event purchasing, corpse trading
   - Karma/fame integration, discovery mechanics
   - ~400 lines comprehensive documentation

2. **`design/mechanics/MoraleBraverySanity.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete psychological warfare system
   - Bravery (core stat), Morale (in-battle), Sanity (long-term)
   - All thresholds, penalties, recovery mechanics
   - Strategic implications and roster management
   - ~350 lines comprehensive documentation

### Files Updated
3. **`design/mechanics/Units.md`**
   - ✅ Updated morale/bravery/sanity section
   - Replaced outdated mechanics with reference to MoraleBraverySanity.md
   - Added all thresholds, penalties, recovery options
   - Strategic implications included

4. **`design/mechanics/Economy.md`**
   - ✅ Updated Black Market section
   - Added reference to comprehensive BlackMarket.md
   - Quick summary of all features

5. **`design/mechanics/Battlescape.md`**
   - ✅ Updated Status Effects & Morale section
   - Added comprehensive quick reference tables
   - Cross-referenced MoraleBraverySanity.md

6. **`design/GLOSSARY.md`**

   - ✅ Updated Sanity definition
   - ✅ Expanded Black Market definition with all services
   - ✅ Added Corpse Trading definition

---

## 2. API LAYER ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Updated
7. **`api/ECONOMY.md`**
   - ✅ Updated BlackMarket entity with new properties
   - Added karma/fame tracking
   - Added special services (missions, events, units, craft, corpses)
   - Added supplier relationships
   - Note: Full function implementations reference design/mechanics/BlackMarket.md

8. **`api/UNITS.md`**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive morale/bravery/sanity functions
   - Morale system functions (15+ functions)
   - Sanity system functions (10+ functions)
   - Bravery modifier functions
   - Combined psychological state functions
   - All functions documented with signatures and descriptions

---

## 3. ARCHITECTURE LAYER ⏭️ NOT NEEDED

**Decision**: Black Market and Morale systems do not create new module dependencies or affect system relationships significantly. They extend existing Economy and Units systems without architectural changes.

**Rationale**:
- Black Market extends existing Economy marketplace
- Morale/Sanity extends existing Units psychological state
- No new inter-system dependencies introduced
- Existing integration points sufficient
