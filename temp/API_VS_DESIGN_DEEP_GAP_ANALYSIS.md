## Conclusion

The API documentation is in **very good shape** with 87.5% alignment to design specifications. Most critical systems (Battlescape, Interception, Crafts) are excellently documented. The primary gaps are in:

1. **Progression Systems** - Medals, training, demotion
2. **Economic Details** - Research tree, suppliers, manufacturing queues
3. **Strategic Mechanics** - Stealth, alliances, embargoes
4. **Cross-System Integration** - Fame/karma, traits, resource flow

Addressing the **12 high-priority gaps** will bring alignment to **92%+** and significantly improve API usability for developers and modders. The remaining medium and low priority gaps are primarily documentation enhancements that improve clarity but don't block implementation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create task in tasks/TODO/ with implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 (high priority gaps)
3. Establish synchronization protocol
4. Schedule monthly gap analysis reviews
