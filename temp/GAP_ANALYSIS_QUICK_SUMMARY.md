## Top 10 High-Priority Gaps to Fix

1. **Medal System** (GAP-U-02) - Achievement tracking not in API
2. **Research Tech Tree** (GAP-E-01) - Dependency graph missing
3. **Supplier System** (GAP-E-03) - Access conditions not detailed
4. **Stealth Mechanics** (GAP-G-03) - UFO stealth not documented
5. **Item Modifications** (GAP-I-02) - Weapon mods not documented
6. **Base Defense** (GAP-BA-02) - Defense facilities incomplete
7. **Alliance Formation** (GAP-P-01) - Diplomatic alliances not detailed
8. **Map Script Commands** (GAP-B-01) - Script structure missing
9. **Trait Effects** (XS-01) - Cross-system trait impacts inconsistent
10. **Fame/Karma System** (XS-02) - Not centralized, needs own API file

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High Priority (Weeks 1-2)
- Address 12 high-priority gaps
- Target: 92% alignment
- Focus: Medal system, Research tree, Supplier details, Stealth

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Weeks 3-4)
- Address 18 medium-priority gaps
- Target: 95% alignment
- Focus: Manufacturing, AI, Facilities, Diplomacy

### Phase 3: Low Priority (Weeks 5-6)
- Address 18 low-priority gaps
- Target: 98% alignment
- Focus: Minor enhancements and clarifications

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 7)
- Document cross-system interactions
- Create resource flow diagrams
- Update INTEGRATION.md

### Phase 5: Validation (Week 8)
- Verify completeness
- Establish synchronization protocol
- Create automation tools

## Quick Actions

**For Developers:**
1. Review high-priority gaps before implementing features
2. Check GAME_API.toml for entity schemas
3. Refer to INTEGRATION.md for system dependencies

**For Modders:**
1. Use completed API sections for modding reference
2. Check gaps list to see what's not yet documented
3. Wait for gap resolution for clearer specifications

**For Project Managers:**
1. 8-week timeline to reach 95% alignment
2. 80-120 hours estimated effort
3. Documentation-only work, no code changes
