## Reasoning & Strategic Depth Added

### Tactical Reasoning
- **Officer placement**: Why center position maximizes aura coverage
- **Panic prevention**: 4 strategies with formation diagrams
- **Squad synergies**: Why Scout + Sniper works (reveal then eliminate)

### Economic Reasoning

- **Queue optimization**: Why fast items first gets gear sooner
- **Black Market trade-offs**: Discovery risk vs. rare item access

### Strategic Reasoning
- **Multi-track research**: How parallel projects save 22 days
- **Facility adjacency**: How clusters create 40% speed bonuses
- **Resource synthesis**: When to synthesize vs. purchase
