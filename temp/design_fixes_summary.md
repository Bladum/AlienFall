## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. Pilot System Contradiction ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: 
- `Units.md` described detailed pilot class system with progression, XP, and dual-role mechanics
- `Crafts.md` stated "crafts have built-in crews (no separate, swappable pilot system)"
- **Direct contradiction** caused confusion about whether pilots exist as separate units

**Resolution**:
- **Aligned both files to Units.md model** (pilots are separate units)
- Updated `Crafts.md` to reflect pilot assignment mechanics
- Added pilot requirements table to craft types
- Created **PilotSystem_Technical.md** as authoritative specification

**Changes Made**:
- `Crafts.md`: Rewritten "Craft Fundamentals" section
- `Crafts.md`: Added "Pilot Requirements" column to craft tables
- `Units.md`: Added cross-reference to technical spec
- **NEW FILE**: `PilotSystem_Technical.md` (complete pilot mechanics)

**Design Decision**: 
Chose **Option A (Pilots as Units)** because:
- More tactical depth (pilot survival matters)
- Better storytelling (ace pilots become legends)
- Aligns with XCOM inspiration (named pilots matter)
- Creates dramatic tension (losing ace pilot is meaningful)

---

### 2. Redundant Craft Files ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- `Craft.md` - Short implementation-focused summary
- `Crafts.md` - Comprehensive design documentation
- **Duplicate content** with different levels of detail

**Resolution**:
- **Deleted `Craft.md`** (redundant)
- Kept `Crafts.md` as authoritative design document
- `Crafts.md` is comprehensive and complete

**Rationale**:
- `Crafts.md` contains all information from `Craft.md` plus much more
- No unique content lost
- Single source of truth established

---

### 3. Diplomatic Relations Redundancy ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- Relationship mechanics scattered across multiple files:
  - `Politics.md` (Fame, Karma, Relationships)
  - `Countries.md` (Country relations)
  - `Economy.md` (Supplier relations)
  - `ai_systems.md` (Faction relations)
- **No unified specification** for relationship mechanics

**Resolution**:
- Created **DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md** as single source of truth
- Extracted universal relationship system (-100 to +100 scale)
- Documented threshold effects for all entity types
- Added cross-references in all related files

**NEW FILE**: `DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md`
- Universal relationship scale definition
- Change mechanics and formulas
- Entity-specific modifiers (countries, suppliers, factions)
- Threshold effects and consequences
- Integration with other systems

**Cross-References Added**:
- `Politics.md`: Link to technical spec
- `Countries.md`: Link to technical spec
- (Future: `Economy.md` and `ai_systems.md` should also reference it)

---

### 4. Technical Specifications Extracted ✅ NEW

**Created Two Technical Reference Documents**:

#### A) PilotSystem_Technical.md
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for pilot mechanics

**Content**:
- Dual progression system (Pilot XP vs Ground XP)
- Assignment mechanics (craft vs battlescape)
- Pilot requirements by craft type
- Pilot bonuses to crafts
- Death/injury mechanics
- Training and progression
- Strategic considerations
- Cross-system integration

**Referenced By**: Units.md, Crafts.md, Interception.md, Basescape.md

#### B) DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for relationship mechanics

**Content**:
- Universal relationship scale (-100 to +100)
- Change mechanics and formulas
- Entity-specific modifiers
- Threshold effects (countries, suppliers, factions)
- Special events (diplomatic crises, betrayals)
- UI elements
- Cross-system integration
- Balance considerations

**Referenced By**: Politics.md, Countries.md, Economy.md, ai_systems.md

**Design Principle**: 
Technical specifications eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency. Instead of duplicating mechanics across multiple files, we now have:
- **Design files** → "What the system does" (high-level)
- **Technical files** → "How it works exactly" (formulas, rules)

---

### 5. Future Opportunities Document ✅ CREATED

**Problem**: Analysis identified many potential improvements but no centralized location for brainstorming.

**Solution**: Created **FutureOpportunities.md** with 10 categories of potential features:

1. **Mid-Game Engagement Systems**
   - Dynamic campaign events (political coups, alien civil wars, research breakthroughs)
   - Strategic meta-objectives (divergent victory paths)

2. **Environmental & Seasonal Systems**
   - Seasonal weather affecting strategy and tactics
   - Dynamic weather events during missions

3. **Advanced Unit Psychology**
   - Personality matrix system (brave, cautious, bloodthirsty, etc.)
   - Unit bond system (friendships, rivalries, mentor-student)
   - Morale cascade mechanics

4. **Cross-System Synergies**
   - Research-combat-diplomacy triangle
   - Economy-politics-fame nexus
   - Base specialization system

5. **Multiplayer & Cooperative Play**
   - Asymmetric co-op (alliance vs rivalry modes)
   - Cold war mode (secret betrayal)
   - Shared research and joint missions

6. **Procedural Content Generation**
   - Procedural campaign generation
   - Random faction traits
   - Emergent narrative events
   - Adaptive difficulty AI

7. **Modular Ruleset System**
   - Custom difficulty modules (realistic logistics, narrative focus, hardcore permadeath)
   - Total conversion support (WW2 mod example)

8. **Narrative & Moral Complexity**
   - Living world simulation (aliens as civilizations)
   - Moral complexity (no clear heroes/villains)
   - Consequence system (late-game revelations)

9. **Quality of Life & Accessibility**
   - AI analyst system (real-time coaching)
   - Adaptive tutorial system
   - Performance profiling

10. **Experimental Game Modes**
    - Timeloop campaign (roguelike meets Groundhog Day)
    - Sandbox creative mode

**File Purpose**:
- Centralized brainstorming location
- Preserves analysis insights
- Provides roadmap for future development
- Not committed features (inspiration only)

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Single Source of Truth
**Before**: Mechanics scattered across multiple files  
**After**: Technical specs centralized, design files reference them

**Example**: Pilot mechanics now in PilotSystem_Technical.md, referenced by Units.md and Crafts.md

### 2. Separation of Concerns
**Before**: Design and implementation mixed  
**After**: Design files focus on "what," technical files focus on "how"

**Example**: Units.md describes pilot classes, PilotSystem_Technical.md describes exact bonuses and formulas

### 3. Cross-Referencing
**Before**: No links between related files  
**After**: Explicit cross-references guide readers

**Example**: "See [PilotSystem_Technical.md](./PilotSystem_Technical.md) for complete mechanics"

### 4. Consistency
**Before**: Contradictions between files  
**After**: Aligned to single model with clear decisions

**Example**: Pilot system aligned to "pilots as separate units" model

### 5. Scalability
**Before**: Adding features requires updating multiple files  
**After**: Technical specs can be updated independently

**Example**: Changing pilot XP formula only requires updating PilotSystem_Technical.md

---

## Remaining Work (Optional)

### Low Priority

1. **Add cross-references to Economy.md**
   - Reference DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md for supplier relations
   - Reference PilotSystem_Technical.md for pilot training costs

2. **Add cross-references to ai_systems.md**
   - Reference DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md for faction AI
   - Reference PilotSystem_Technical.md for pilot AI

3. **Create coordinate system quick reference**
   - One-page cheat sheet for hex system
   - Referenced from analysis (section 3.1)

4. **Clarify Basescape grid system**
   - Basescape.md mentions "square grid" which may be outdated
   - Verify if using hex or square grid for facility placement

### Future Enhancements

5. **Implement opportunities from FutureOpportunities.md**
   - Prioritize based on impact and feasibility
   - Create design documents for chosen features
   - See "Prioritized Action Plan" in analysis document
