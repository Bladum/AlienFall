## 🎉 Cleanup Actions Summary

### Phase 1: Delete Empty Folders ✅
**Removed:** 1 completely empty directory
```
❌ tools/spritesheet_generator/cfg/
   Status: DELETED
   Impact: Cleanup
```

### Phase 2: Archive Placeholder Folders ✅
**Moved:** 3 folders to _FUTURE_FEATURES/
```
📦 engine/network/                    → _FUTURE_FEATURES/network

```

### Phase 3: Mark Placeholder Systems ✅
**Updated:** 12 README files with implementation status

```
Updated README files with [STATUS] markers:

engine/ai/diplomacy/              → [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
engine/assets/fonts/              → [PLACEHOLDER - Awaiting font files]

engine/politics/diplomacy/        → [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
engine/politics/government/       → [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]
```

### Phase 4: Consolidate Test Frameworks ✅
**Removed:** Duplicate test structure
```
Consolidation:
✗ tests/frameworks/                   (removed - duplicate)
  ├─ test_framework.lua              → tests/framework/test_framework_base.lua
  └─ ui_test_framework.lua           → tests/framework/ui_test_framework_base.lua

✓ tests/framework/                    (unified location)
  ├─ assertions.lua
  ├─ report_generator.lua
  ├─ test_executor.lua
  ├─ test_helpers.lua
  ├─ test_registry.lua
  ├─ test_suite.lua
  ├─ ui_test_engine.lua
  ├─ ui_test_runner.lua
  ├─ yaml_parser.lua
  ├─ test_framework_base.lua          (from consolidation)
  ├─ ui_test_framework_base.lua       (from consolidation)
  └─ ui_testing_legacy/              (reorganized)
```

### Phase 5: Test & Commit ✅
**Verified:** Game runs successfully after changes
```
✓ Game launches without errors
✓ No broken imports or references
✓ All changes committed to git
✓ Commit message: "Workspace cleanup: Archive placeholders, mark stubs, consolidate test frameworks"
```

## 📂 New Project Structure Elements

### _FUTURE_FEATURES/ (New)
```
_FUTURE_FEATURES/
├─ network/              (Multiplayer placeholder)
├─ portal/               (Portal system placeholder)
└─ lore_events/          (Event system placeholder)
```

### tests/framework/ (Consolidated)
```
tests/framework/         (Unified test location)
├─ test_framework_base.lua
├─ ui_test_framework_base.lua
└─ ui_testing_legacy/    (Reorganized subfolder)
```

---

## 🔍 Files with Status Markers

All these files now clearly indicate their implementation status at the top:

```
**Status:** [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] (Placeholder - Planned for Phase X)
**Status:** [PLACEHOLDER - Awaiting asset files]
**Status:** [PLACEHOLDER - Structure ready, implementation in progress]
**Status:** [PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION - Core framework ready]
```

This makes it immediately clear which folders are:
- ✅ Active systems (no status marker)
- 🟡 Partial implementations (clearly marked)
- 🔴 Not yet started (clearly marked)
- 📦 Archived for future (moved to _FUTURE_FEATURES/)
