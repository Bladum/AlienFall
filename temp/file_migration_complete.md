# ✅ File Migration Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Task:** Migrate MD files to correct folders  
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## 📋 Files Migrated

### From docs/ to temp/ (6 status files)
These are temporary status/tracking files that belong in temp/, not permanent documentation:

1. ✅ `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` → `temp/`
2. ✅ `EXPANSION_TEMPLATE.md` → `temp/`
3. ✅ `FINAL_STATUS.md` → `temp/`
4. ✅ `MODULES_COMPLETE.md` → `temp/`
5. ✅ `SYSTEMS_RESTORED.md` → `temp/`
6. ✅ `WORK_STATUS.md` → `temp/`

**Reason:** These files track work progress and are temporary by nature. They should be in temp/, not in the permanent documentation hub.
