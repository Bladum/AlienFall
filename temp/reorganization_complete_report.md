## Usage Guide

### For New Users
1. Read **Overview.md** first (project vision)
2. Read **HexSystem.md** second (coordinate system used everywhere)
3. Follow the reading order in **README.md**
4. Use Quick Navigation table to jump to specific topics

### For Specific Questions
Use the Quick Navigation table in README.md:

| Question | File | Section |
|----------|------|---------|
| "How do pilots work?" | Units.md | ¬ßUnified Pilot Specification |
| "What mission types exist?" | Missions.md | ¬ßMission Types |
| "How does weather work?" | Environment.md | ¬ßWeather System |
| "What's the research tree?" | Economy.md | ¬ßResearch Tree (needs expansion) |
| "How do salvage work?" | Economy.md | ¬ßSalvage System (needs expansion) |

### For Implementation
1. Check README.md for canonical sources (marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è)
2. Read canonical source first
3. Check Related Content section for integration points
4. Read Implementation Notes at end of documents

---

## Remaining Work (Phase 4 - Optional)

### Low Priority Polish
1. Expand Economy.md with Research Tree section (mentioned but not detailed)
2. Expand Economy.md with Salvage System section (mentioned but not detailed)
3. Expand Economy.md with Transfer System section (mentioned but not detailed)
4. Add "Related Content" sections to remaining files
5. Standardize headers across all files
6. Update Glossary.md with new terms

**Note**: These are enhancements, not critical. Core reorganization is complete and functional.
