## Summary

- Dual XP tracks (Pilot XP vs Ground XP)
- Crew bonuses (co-pilots, gunners)
- Minimum pilot rank requirements

### NEW System ✅
- **Piloting is just a stat** (0-100, like Strength)
- **Any unit can pilot** (no special class)
- **One unified XP pool** (ground or air XP contributes equally)
- **Only pilot provides bonuses** (crew = cargo, no bonuses)

## The New System in 3 Sentences

1. Units have a **Piloting stat** (0-100) that improves with any XP
2. Assign unit to pilot slot → provides craft bonuses based on Piloting stat
3. Crew/passengers = cargo (no bonuses at all)

**Formula**: Craft Dodge/Accuracy = Base + (Pilot Piloting / 5)%

**All Done!** ✅

Simple. Clear. Strategic.
