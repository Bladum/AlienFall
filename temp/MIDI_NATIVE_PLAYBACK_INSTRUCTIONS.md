# MIDI Audio Integration - DOWNLOAD REQUIRED

## Status: Code Ready - DLL Download Needed

I've integrated native MIDI playback into AlienFall using the lovemidi library. However, **you need to download the midi.dll file** to enable actual audio playback.

## What I Did

1. ‚úÖ Created lovemidi wrapper (`engine/libs/lovemidi/midi.lua`)
2. ‚úÖ Created native MIDI player (`engine/audio/midi_player_native.lua`)
3. ‚úÖ Updated AudioManager to use native player when available
4. ‚úÖ Added automatic fallback to parser-only mode if DLL not found
5. ‚úÖ Moved Metallica MIDI to correct location (`engine/assets/music/midi/`)

## What You Need to Do

### Download midi.dll

**Option 1: From GitHub Release (Easiest)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/SiENcE/lovemidi
2. Check the "Releases" section
3. Download `midi.dll` for your architecture (probably x64)
4. Place it in: `C:\Users\tombl\Documents\Projects\engine\libs\lovemidi\midi.dll`

**Option 2: Build from Source**
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow build instructions
3. Place compiled DLL in the same location

### File Location

Place the DLL here:
```
C:\Users\tombl\Documents\Projects\engine\libs\lovemidi\midi.dll
```

Or alternatively in the game root:
```
C:\Users\tombl\Documents\Projects\midi.dll
```

## Testing

After placing the DLL:

1. Run the game: `lovec "engine"`
2. Look for console message:
   - ‚úÖ `[lovemidi] Loaded MIDI library from: ...`
   - ‚úÖ `[AudioManager] Using native MIDI player (with real audio)`
   
   OR
   
   - ‚ùå `[lovemidi] ERROR: Could not load midi.dll`
   - ‚ùå `[AudioManager] Using fallback MIDI player (parser only - no audio)`

3. Go to MIDI Test screen and try playing:
   - Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.mid
   - Metallica_-_Hit_The_Lights.mid
   - random_song.mid
   - sample.mid

## Current MIDI Files

All MIDI files are now in: `engine/assets/music/midi/`
- ‚úÖ Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.mid
- ‚úÖ Metallica_-_Hit_The_Lights.mid
- ‚úÖ random_song.mid
- ‚úÖ sample.mid

## How It Works

### With midi.dll:
1. Uses Windows MIDI API via FFI
2. Real audio playback through system synthesizer
3. Full playback controls (play/pause/stop/seek)
4. Volume control
5. Position tracking

### Without midi.dll:
1. Falls back to parser-only mode
2. Files are parsed but no audio
3. Useful for development/testing file detection

## API Usage

The AudioManager API remains the same:

```lua
AudioManager:playMIDI("Metallica_-_Hit_The_Lights")
AudioManager:stopMIDI()
AudioManager:pauseMIDI()
AudioManager:resumeMIDI()
AudioManager:setMIDIVolume(0.6)
```

## Troubleshooting

### No audio but no errors

Check that:
1. `midi.dll` is in the correct location
2. Console shows "native MIDI player" message
3. Windows MIDI service is running
4. System volume is not muted

### DLL not loading

- Make sure it's the correct architecture (x64 for 64-bit Love2D)
- Check Windows Defender didn't block it
- Try placing in game root instead

### Poor audio quality

Windows uses built-in General MIDI synthesizer. Quality varies by Windows version. For better quality, consider using external soundfonts or VST hosts.

## Next Steps

1. Download and install midi.dll
2. Test playback
3. Enjoy real MIDI audio! üéµ
