**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Concrete action items derived from comprehensive quality analysis  
**Organization:** By priority and dependency chains

---

## Critical Path Items (Block MVP)

### 1. Test Infrastructure Repair üî¥
**Status:** BLOCKING  
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Owner:** Technical Lead

**Problem:**
```
[ERROR] Smoke test runner failed: main.lua:84: module 'tests2.smoke' not found
```

**Root Cause:** Love2D doesn't automatically add parent directory as module root.

**Solution Options:**
1. ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED: Use love.filesystem** (most Love2D-native)
   ```lua
   -- In tests2/main.lua, replace require() with:
   local testFiles = love.filesystem.getDirectoryItems("tests2/smoke")
   for _, file in ipairs(testFiles) do
       if file:match("_test%.lua$") then
           local chunk = love.filesystem.load("tests2/smoke/" .. file)
           chunk()
       end
   end
   ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alternative: Modify package.path**
   ```lua
   -- In tests2/conf.lua
   function love.conf(t)
       t.console = true
       package.path = package.path .. ";./?/init.lua;./?.lua"
   end
   ```

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alternative: Console runner from engine/**
   ```bash
   # Create engine/test_runner.lua that properly loads tests
