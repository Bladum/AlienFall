> **Analysis Date**: 2025-10-28  
> **Analyzed Files**: 27 mechanics documents  
> **Purpose**: Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and propose file organization strategy

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **File Size Imbalance**: Wide variation from 200 lines (BlackMarket.md, Assets.md) to 1200+ lines (Battlescape.md, AI.md, Basescape.md)
2. **Cross-Reference Issues**: 23+ broken or missing cross-references between files
3. **Duplicate Content**: Several systems described in multiple files with minor variations
4. **Missing Documentation**: 8 major gaps in critical systems
5. **Inconsistent Depth**: Some files are comprehensive specifications, others are outlines

### Critical Gaps Identified

- **Hex coordinate system** referenced everywhere but not in mechanics/ folder (found in design/mechanics/ but missing from index)
- **Pilot system** mechanics spread across Units.md, Crafts.md, and Pilots.md with contradictions
- **Research tree** described conceptually but no actual tree structure documented
- **Mission generation** described in AI.md but not in Missions.md (which doesn't exist)
- **Salvage system** mentioned 40+ times but never fully specified
- **Transfer system** referenced in multiple files but incomplete specification

---

## Part 1: Content Gaps & Inconsistencies

### CRITICAL GAPS (Block Implementation)

#### 1. Missing HexSystem.md in Mechanics Folder

**Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL - Referenced 15+ times but not in main index**

**Issue**: 
- README.md lists "hex_vertical_axial_system.md" as core reading
- Battlescape.md references it extensively
- File appears to exist but not in standard location or not indexed properly

**Impact**: Cannot implement any spatial systems without coordinate system specification

**Action Required**:
1. Verify if `hex_vertical_axial_system.md` exists
2. Move to `design/mechanics/HexSystem.md` or update all references
3. Add to README.md core documents section

---

#### 2. Pilot System Contradictions

**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT - Three different specifications**

**Contradictions Found**:

| Aspect | Pilots.md | Units.md | Crafts.md |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Pilot count per craft | "1+ pilots based on craft type" | "Any unit can pilot" | "Requires 1 pilot (any)" |
| Pilot specialization | Dedicated pilot class | Piloting stat on all units | Fighter Pilot class exists |
| XP system | Separate Pilot XP track | Standard unit XP | "Pilots gain experience" (unspecified) |
| Reassignment | "Can switch to ground combat" | Not mentioned | "Pilots assigned to crafts" |

**Example from Crafts.md**:
> "Each craft requires 1+ pilot units based on craft type"

**But later in same file**:
> "Note: All crafts require 1 pilot. Any unit can pilot any craft."

**Action Required**:
1. Create unified Pilot System specification
2. Decide: Dedicated pilot class OR universal piloting stat
3. Update all three files consistently
4. Document in SYNCHRONIZATION_GUIDE.md

---

**Integration Points Referenced**:
- Overview.md: "Integration: How Systems Connect" (conceptual only)
- Basescape.md: "Base Integration & Feedback Loops" (incomplete)
- Economy.md: No integration section
- Geoscape.md: No integration section

**Missing Details**:
- Exact data flow between systems
- State synchronization rules
- Event propagation mechanics
- Feedback loop formulas

**Action Required**:
1. Create `Integration.md` or expand each system's integration section
2. Document:
   - Data dependencies (what reads/writes what)
   - Event triggers and handlers
   - State synchronization requirements
   - API contracts between systems

---

### MODERATE GAPS (Should Address Soon)

#### 9. Event System Not Documented

**References**: Countries.md, Politics.md, BlackMarket.md mention "events" but no unified event system

**Action**: Create `Events.md` documenting:
- Event types (political, economic, military, alien)
- Trigger conditions
- Effect specifications
- Duration mechanics

---

#### 10. Perks System Mentioned But Not Found

**References**: 
- README.md lists `Perks.md` in file structure
- Units.md mentions "perks" and "traits" interchangeably
- No actual Perks.md file found in analysis

**Action**: 
1. Verify if Perks.md exists
2. If exists, integrate with Units.md
3. If missing, document perk system in Units.md or create file

---

#### 11. Weapons & Combat Formulas Incomplete

**Issues**:
- Battlescape.md has accuracy formula but damage formula incomplete
- Weapon modes specified but AP costs inconsistent
- Range mechanics mentioned but not fully defined

**Action**: Expand Battlescape.md combat sections with:
- Complete damage formula
- All weapon mode specifications
- Range penalty tables
- Ammunition mechanics

---

#### 12. Facility Adjacency Bonus Inconsistency

**Issue**:
- Basescape.md lists adjacency bonuses
- Some bonuses reference "1-hex touching"
- Some reference "2-hex distance"
- Grid system is square but bonuses assume hex?

**Contradiction**:
> "Facility Grid System: Square grid (x-axis horizontal, y-axis vertical)"

But then:
> "Adjacency Bonuses: Must be orthogonally adjacent (4-directional only)"

And later:
> "Power Plant + Lab/Workshop: +10% efficiency | Within 2-hex distance"

**Action**: Clarify if "hex" is terminology carryover or actual distance metric on square grid

---

#### 13. Karma & Fame Systems Overlap

**Issue**:
- Karma described in Politics.md and BlackMarket.md
- Fame described in Finance.md and BlackMarket.md
- Unclear if these are same system or different
- Different thresholds listed in different files

**Action**: Create unified `Reputation.md` or consolidate in Politics.md

---

#### 14. Manufacturing vs. Research Priorities Unclear

**Issue**:
- Both systems compete for same personnel (units allocated as scientists/engineers)
- No clear priority system documented
- Resource allocation mechanics vague

**Action**: Add priority/allocation system to Economy.md

---

#### 15. Base Defense Mission vs. Basescape Integration

**Issue**:
- Base Defense is a mission type (Battlescape)
- Base Defense facilities exist (Basescape: Turrets)
- Integration between these not documented
- Do turrets participate in Base Defense missions?

**Action**: Document integration in Basescape.md Base Defense section

---

### MINOR GAPS (Nice to Have)

#### 16. Victory Conditions Not Specified

**References**: Overview.md mentions "No fixed victory conditions; sandbox"

**But**: Multiple "campaign end" references suggest victory exists

**Action**: Clarify in Overview.md or create `Victory.md`

---

#### 17. Modding System Referenced But Not Specified

**Issue**: Multiple references to "moddable" and "TOML content" but no mechanics documented

**Action**: Already covered in `api/MODDING_GUIDE.md` - add cross-reference to mechanics README

---

#### 18. Tutorial System Not Mentioned

**Issue**: Complex game with no tutorial system documented

**Action**: Consider adding Tutorial.md if tutorials are planned

---

#### 19. Save/Load System Not Mentioned

**Issue**: "save/load progression" mentioned in Overview.md but no mechanics

**Action**: Low priority, likely engine concern not design

---

#### 20. Difficulty Scaling Inconsistent

**Issue**: 
- Battlescape.md has difficulty table
- AI.md has different scaling formulas
- Geoscape.md mentions difficulty but no specifics

**Action**: Create unified difficulty scaling specification

---

## Part 2: Cross-Reference Issues

### Broken or Missing References

#### 1. README.md References

**Issue**: README.md lists files that don't match actual filenames:

Listed in README.md:
- `hex_vertical_axial_system.md` → Not found in analysis
- `PilotSystem_Technical.md` → Found as `Pilots.md`
- `DiplomaticRelations_Technical.md` → Found as `Relations.md`
- `ai_systems.md` → Found as `AI.md`
- `FutureOpportunities.md` → Found as `Future.md`

**Action**: Update README.md filenames or rename files for consistency

---

#### 2. Cross-Reference Validation Needed

Many files reference others using inconsistent naming:
- Some use "See X.md"
- Some use "See **X.md**"
- Some use "Related Systems: X"
- Some use full relative paths

**Action**: Standardize cross-reference format

---

## Part 3: File Organization Strategy

### Current Problems

1. **Inconsistent File Sizes**: 200-line files next to 1200-line files
2. **Topic Overlap**: Pilot system in 3 files, economy topics in 4 files
3. **Depth Variation**: Some files are detailed specs, others are outlines
4. **Navigation Difficulty**: 27 files without clear hierarchy

   - Pure addition

**Phase 4 Result**: Same 30 files, polished and professional

---

## OPTIONAL Phase 5: Future Reorganization (If Desired Later)

**ONLY if team decides duplication is problematic:**

Could create "archive/" folder and move superseded files there:
- `archive/Pilots.md` (if team prefers single source in Units.md)
- `archive/Relations.md` (if team prefers unified Politics.md)
- But keep files accessible, never delete

**NOT RECOMMENDED NOW** - better to have multiple perspectives than risk losing content

---

---

## Conclusion

The design documentation is comprehensive and valuable. Rather than removing or consolidating, the strategy is to **enhance and organize** through pure additions.

### Zero-Deletion Strategy Will:

1. **Preserve all existing work** - Every file, every sentence remains
2. **Fill critical gaps** - Add 3 new comprehensive files (Missions, Environment, Integration)
3. **Resolve contradictions** - Mark canonical sources without deleting alternatives
4. **Improve navigation** - Fix references, add cross-links, create index
5. **Enhance clarity** - Expand sections with detailed specifications
6. **Maintain context** - Multiple perspectives on same topic = good documentation

### Key Benefits:

✅ **Zero Risk** - No content loss possible  
✅ **Incremental** - Can stop at any phase without harm  
✅ **Reversible** - All changes are additions, easy to undo  
✅ **Collaborative** - Original authors' work fully preserved  
✅ **Comprehensive** - More information, better organization  
✅ **Flexible** - Future consolidation optional, not mandatory  

### Content Philosophy:

**"Redundancy is a feature, not a bug"**

- Having pilot mechanics in 3 files means 3 perspectives
- Each file can be read independently
- Contradictions marked with canonical source
- No single point of failure
- Rich context preserved

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks of focused documentation work

**Priority**: High - Current gaps block implementation, but zero risk to existing work

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 - Create Missions.md, Environment.md, and Integration.md

**Risk Level**: ZERO - Only additions, no deletions, fully reversible
