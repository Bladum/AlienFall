## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Mid-Game Engagement Crisis (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Months 4-8 lack compelling progression hooks between early discovery and late-game escalation.

**Evidence**:
- Research tree has linear dependencies (no branching choices until late game)
- Mission variety doesn't scale with player capability
- Economic system stabilizes too quickly (no pressure after month 4)
- Unit progression plateaus at Rank 2-3 (Rank 4+ requires exponential XP)
- No dynamic campaign events to inject unpredictability

**Player Experience Impact**:
- "Grind phase" where players repeat same mission types
- Optimal strategy becomes predictable (rush tier 2 tech → farm missions)
- Dropout risk high around month 5-6 (20-30 hours played)

**Recommended Solutions**:

1. **Add Strategic Dilemmas (High Priority)**
```yaml
Implementation: Procedural event system at months 4-8
Events:
  - Political coups requiring player intervention
  - Alien faction civil wars (opportunity for exploitation)
  - Scientific breakthroughs with risks/rewards
  - Diplomatic crises forcing hard choices
Frequency: 1 major event per 2 months
Impact: Forces strategy adaptation, breaks routine
```

2. **Introduce Divergent Victory Paths (Medium Priority)**
```yaml
Unlock: Month 4 based on player playstyle
Paths:
  - Technological Supremacy (research-focused)
  - Diplomatic Unification (relations-focused)
  - Military Domination (combat-focused)
  - Shadow Conspiracy (karma-focused)
Effect: Creates narrative goals beyond "survive"
Benefit: 4x replayability, clear player identity
```

3. **Dynamic Difficulty Escalation (High Priority)**
```yaml
Current: Linear escalation (month × 0.2)
Problem: Predictable, doesn't adapt to player power
Proposed: Adaptive AI that scales to player performance
  - Track player win/loss ratio
  - If win rate > 75%: +30% enemy strength next mission
  - If win rate < 40%: -20% enemy strength, unlock "Emergency Aid"
  - Monthly recalibration based on global score
Benefit: Maintains challenge without punishing learning
```

---

### 2. Economic Balance Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Economy stabilizes too quickly, removing strategic pressure.

**Evidence from Documentation**:
- Manufacturing is 30-50% cheaper than marketplace (always optimal after month 2)
- No opportunity costs for research (run multiple parallel tracks)
- Debt system triggers too late (bankruptcy already occurred)
- Inflation penalty applies at 20× monthly income (unrealistic threshold)
- No resource scarcity mechanics (fuel/materials always available)

**Broken Feedback Loops**:

```
Current Loop (Exploitable):
Mission Success → Salvage → Manufacturing → Better Equipment → 
Easier Missions → More Salvage → Runaway Wealth

Intended Loop (Missing Pressure):
Mission Success → Funding Increase → Expand Operations → 
More Bases → Higher Maintenance → Tighter Budget → 
Strategic Choices Required
```

**Specific Issues**:

1. **Manufacturing Dominance**
   - Once Workshop built (month 2), marketplace becomes obsolete
   - No capacity limits on manufacturing queues
   - Batch bonuses stack infinitely (10% per unit)
   - No maintenance costs for manufactured equipment

2. **Research Opportunity Cost Missing**
   - Can research everything given enough time
   - No branching tech trees (all paths available)
   - Scientist allocation has diminishing returns but no hard caps
   - No competing urgent research (alien tech adapts too slowly)

3. **Funding System Too Generous**
   - Base funding: 100% of country defense budget
   - Each country provides 10K-50K monthly (5-10 countries = 200K+ monthly)
   - Mission rewards: 1,000-2,000 credits (trivial compared to funding)
   - No inflation from market saturation (selling salvage)

**Recommended Solutions**:

1. **Introduce Resource Scarcity (High Priority)**
```yaml
Fuel System:
  - Fuel capacity per base: 1,000 units (not infinite)
  - Craft consumption: 10-50 fuel per hex traveled
  - Strategic choice: Deploy multiple craft OR maintain reserves
  - Empty tank = stranded craft (rescue mission required)

Material Shortages:
  - Random monthly events: "Titanium shortage" (-50% availability)
  - Forces adaptation: Use alternative equipment, delay manufacturing
  - Black market bypass: Pay 3× price for scarce materials (karma hit)

Research Competition:
  - Aliens also research (unlock new tech every 2 months)
  - Player must prioritize: Counter alien advances OR research offense
  - Missing counter-tech = harder missions (25% difficulty increase)
```

2. **Manufacturing Capacity Limits (Medium Priority)**
```yaml
Current: Unlimited queue, no time pressure
Proposed:
  - Workshop capacity: 5 concurrent projects max
  - Advanced Workshop: 10 concurrent projects
  - Manufacturing Hub: 20 concurrent projects
  - Queue overflow = 2× production time penalty
  - Strategic choice: Wide production vs. deep specialization

Engineer Allocation Rework:
  - Current: Diminishing returns (80% at 5, 60% at 10)
  - Proposed: Hard cap at 10 engineers per project
  - Excess engineers reallocate automatically to queue
  - Benefit: Encourages parallel production, reduces min-max
```

3. **Dynamic Economy Pressure (High Priority)**
```yaml
Inflation System Rework:
  - Current: 20× monthly income threshold (too high)
  - Proposed: Progressive taxation
    - Credits < 5× monthly: No penalty
    - Credits 5-10×: 5% monthly wealth tax
    - Credits 10-20×: 10% monthly wealth tax
    - Credits 20×+: 15% monthly wealth tax + marketplace inflation
  - Reason: "You're printing money, markets react"
  - Forces reinvestment: Build bases, equipment, research

Country Funding Volatility:
  - Current: Stable funding, predictable income
  - Proposed: Monthly variance ±20% based on:
    - Recent mission performance (last 3 missions)
    - Public confidence (civilian casualties)
    - Political stability (random events)
    - Competing priorities (countries face own crises)
  - Benefit: Unpredictable income = strategic reserves needed
```

### 3. Unit Progression Imbalance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: XP requirements scale exponentially, creating progression wall.

**Evidence**:
```
Rank 1: 100 XP (achievable in 3-5 missions)
Rank 2: 300 XP (8-12 missions, reasonable)
Rank 3: 600 XP (20-25 missions, slow but doable)
Rank 4: 1,000 XP (35-40 missions, tedious grind)
Rank 5: 1,500 XP (55-60 missions, unrealistic)
Rank 6: 2,100 XP (75+ missions, effectively impossible)
```

**Player Impact**:
- Most units plateau at Rank 2-3 (months 4-6)
- Rank 4+ abilities never experienced by 80%+ of players
- Hero units (Rank 6) require 75+ missions = 12+ months of focused grinding
- No alternative progression paths (traits, equipment specialization)

**Design Issues**:

1. **Exponential Scaling Too Steep**
   - Jump from Rank 3→4: +400 XP (67% increase)
   - Jump from Rank 5→6: +600 XP (40% increase)
   - No catchup mechanics for new recruits

2. **Mission XP Too Low**
   - Combat kill: 10-20 XP
   - Mission completion: 25-50 XP
   - Typical mission: 60-100 XP total per unit
   - Rank 6 requires 2,100 XP = 21-35 missions (8-12 game months)

3. **No Alternative Progression**
   - Traits are random at recruitment (no earning through play)
   - Equipment has no "mastery" bonuses (no weapon specialization)
   - No cross-training (pilots can't learn battlescape skills passively)

**Recommended Solutions**:

1. **Rebalance XP Curve (High Priority)**
```yaml
Proposed Curve (More Accessible):
Rank 1: 100 XP (unchanged)
Rank 2: 250 XP (was 300, -17%)
Rank 3: 500 XP (was 600, -17%)
Rank 4: 800 XP (was 1000, -20%)
Rank 5: 1,200 XP (was 1500, -20%)
Rank 6: 1,700 XP (was 2100, -19%)

Reasoning:
- Rank 4 achievable in 12-15 missions (realistic)
- Rank 5 achievable in 20-25 missions (dedicated player)
- Rank 6 achievable in 30-35 missions (elite veteran)
- Still requires commitment but feels attainable
```

2. **Add Alternative Progression Systems (Medium Priority)**
```yaml
Weapon Mastery System:
  - Track kills per weapon type (rifle, sniper, shotgun, etc.)
  - Every 10 kills: +2% accuracy, +5% crit chance with that weapon
  - Cap: 50 kills = +10% accuracy, +25% crit (max mastery)
  - Visual: Weapon icon shows stars (1-5 stars for mastery level)
  - Benefit: Veterans feel specialized even at same rank

Combat Role Specialization:
  - Track combat behaviors (aggressive, defensive, support)
  - Unit naturally evolves toward preferred playstyle
  - Aggressive: +15% damage after 20+ kills
  - Defensive: +15% armor after 20+ overwatch activations
  - Support: +50% healing/buff after 20+ support actions
  - Benefit: Emergent identity without micromanagement

Cross-Training System:
  - Pilots gain +1 Piloting per 5 interception missions (unchanged)
  - NEW: Pilots gain +0.5 Aim per 10 ground missions (battlescape)
  - NEW: Ground units gain +0.5 Piloting per 10 air missions (cross-skill)
  - Benefit: Units can switch roles without starting from zero
```

3. **Catchup Mechanics for New Recruits (Low Priority)**
```yaml
Veteran Mentorship:
  - If squad has 2+ Rank 3+ units, new recruits gain +50% XP
  - Represents training and battlefield learning
  - Prevents "roster lock" where player afraid to recruit

Accelerated Training Facility:
  - Base facility: "Training Grounds" (2×2)
  - Effect: Units assigned gain +10 XP per day (passive)
  - Cost: 5,000 credits maintenance per month
  - Strategic choice: Fast-track rookies OR save money
```

---

### 4. Pilot System Integration Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Pilot system is mechanically isolated from core unit progression.

**Evidence**:
- Piloting is a unit stat (0-100) but only affects craft bonuses
- Pilots gain XP from interception OR ground combat (shared pool)
- No pilot-specific class progression (just units with high Piloting stat)
- Pilot bonuses are formulaic (Piloting/5 = flat % bonus)
- No emergent pilot identity (ace pilots vs. transport specialists)

**Design Friction**:

1. **Role Ambiguity**
   - Documentation states "units are soldiers who CAN pilot" (Pilots.md)
   - But Units.md lists "Pilot" as separate Rank 1 class path
   - Players confused: "Is Pilot a class or just a role assignment?"

2. **Shallow Specialization**
   - All pilots improve craft the same way (Piloting/5 formula)
   - No distinction between fighter pilot, bomber pilot, transport pilot
   - Special abilities unlock at flat thresholds (50, 70, 90 Piloting)
   - No tactical choice in pilot development

3. **XP Double-Dipping Exploit**
   - Pilots gain XP from interceptions (air combat)
   - Same pilots gain XP from ground combat (battlescape)
   - Optimal strategy: Assign best units as pilots (double XP sources)
   - Undermines specialization fantasy

**Recommended Solutions**:

1. **Clarify Pilot as Role, Not Class (High Priority)**
```yaml
Documentation Fix:
  - Remove "Pilot" from Rank 1 class progression in Units.md
  - Clarify: Piloting is a STAT, not a CLASS
  - Any unit can pilot any craft (high Piloting = better performance)
  - Some classes have Piloting bonuses (Scout +10, Sniper +5)
  - Benefit: Removes confusion, aligns docs

Mechanical Reinforcement:
  - Rename "Pilot" class references to "Flight Officer" (descriptive title)
  - Flight Officer = Scout-class unit with high Piloting (not separate track)
  - Clear distinction: Class (Scout) vs. Stat (Piloting) vs. Role (Assigned to craft)
```

2. **Add Pilot Specialization Tracks (Medium Priority)**
```yaml
Fighter Pilot Path:
  - Unlock: 30+ Piloting + 10 interceptions
  - Bonuses: +20% craft accuracy, +15% dodge
  - Special: "Dogfighter" - Auto-evade first incoming missile
  - Identity: Aggressive air superiority specialist

Bomber Pilot Path:
  - Unlock: 30+ Piloting + 5 ground support missions
  - Bonuses: +30% bomb damage, -20% craft dodge
  - Special: "Precision Strike" - Guarantee hit on stationary targets
  - Identity: Surgical strike specialist, high risk/reward

Transport Pilot Path:
  - Unlock: 30+ Piloting + 15 troop deployments
  - Bonuses: +50% fuel efficiency, +2 cargo capacity
  - Special: "Emergency Extraction" - Can land on any terrain
  - Identity: Utility and survivability, logistics master

Ace Pilot (Elite):
  - Unlock: 70+ Piloting + 25 interceptions
  - Combines all specializations at 50% effectiveness
  - Special: "Ace Maneuver" - Perfect dodge + guaranteed crit (once per battle)
  - Identity: Legendary hero unit
```

3. **Fix XP Double-Dipping Exploit (Low Priority)**
```yaml
Option A: Separate XP Pools (Complex)
  - Ground Combat XP: Affects battlescape stats
  - Air Combat XP: Affects Piloting stat only
  - Problem: Increases complexity, tracking burden

Option B: Role Lock During Missions (Simple)
  - Pilot assigned to craft: Gains air XP only (cannot deploy to ground)
  - Ground unit deployed: Gains ground XP only (cannot pilot simultaneously)
  - Current mission = commit to role
  - Benefit: Clear tradeoff, maintains simplicity

Recommended: Option B (simpler implementation)
```

### 5. Basescape Grid System Confusion (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Documentation states square grid, but references hex system.

**Evidence**:
- Basescape.md: "Base facilities exist on a **square grid**"
- Basescape.md: "Creates rectangular base perimeter with predictable geometry"
- But also: "Grid Type: Orthogonal Square" vs. project uses hex everywhere else

**Clarification Needed**:
1. Is Basescape actually square grid (exception to universal hex system)?
2. If yes, why does it differ from Geoscape/Battlescape (both hex)?
3. If no, update documentation to specify hex grid parameters

**Recommended Solution**:
```yaml
Design Decision Required:
Option A: Square Grid (Current Design)
  - Pros: Simpler facility placement, familiar building pattern
  - Cons: Inconsistent with other layers, coordinate conversion needed
  - Use Case: If base building is separate mini-game

Option B: Hex Grid (Consistent)
  - Pros: Unified coordinate system, no conversion
  - Cons: Facilities look "tilted", less intuitive for rectangular buildings
  - Use Case: If bases are integrated with tactical layer (base defense)

Recommendation: Keep square grid, but explicitly document WHY
  - "Basescape uses square grid (exception to hex system) because..."
  - "Facilities designed for rectangular architecture (reactors, barracks)"
  - "Base defense missions convert square → hex during battlescape phase"
```

---

### 6. Combat Formula Documentation Gaps (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Missing critical combat calculations in Battlescape.md.

**Gaps Identified**:

1. **Damage Reduction Formula Missing**
```yaml
Documented:
  - Armor Value: 0-2 base + equipment bonuses
  - "Each armor point reduces incoming damage by 1 point"
  
Missing:
  - How do damage types interact with armor? (Kinetic vs. Energy vs. Explosive)
  - Does armor reduce ALL damage or only specific types?
  - What happens when armor exceeds damage? (0 damage or minimum 1?)
  - Critical hits? (Docs state "no critical hits" but needs confirmation)

Proposed Formula:
  Effective Armor = Base Armor × Damage Type Modifier
  Final Damage = max(1, Weapon Damage - Effective Armor)
  
  Damage Type Modifiers:
    Kinetic: 100% armor effectiveness (rifles, melee)
    Energy: 50% armor effectiveness (lasers, plasma)
    Explosive: 25% armor effectiveness (grenades, rockets)
    Psionic: 0% armor effectiveness (mind attacks)
    Hazard: 75% armor effectiveness (fire, acid)
```

2. **Accuracy Calculation Incomplete**
```yaml
Documented:
  - Aim Stat: 6-12 base
  - "Equipment accuracy bonuses, status effects, movement penalties"
  - "Minimum 5% accuracy, maximum 95% accuracy"

Missing:
  - Exact formula for accuracy calculation
  - How does distance affect accuracy?
  - Cover bonuses/penalties?
  - Height advantage modifiers?

Proposed Formula:
  Base Hit Chance = (Unit Aim × 5) + Weapon Accuracy - Distance Penalty
  Distance Penalty = (Current Range - Optimal Range) × 2% per hex
  Cover Modifier = -20% (half cover), -40% (full cover)
  Height Advantage = +10% (attacking from higher elevation)
  Movement Penalty = -30% (moved this turn), -50% (dash)
  
  Final Hit Chance = clamp(5%, Base + Modifiers, 95%)
```

3. **Status Effect Duration Missing**
```yaml
Documented:
  - Status effects exist (stunned, panicked, burning, etc.)
  - Effects reduce AP or cause damage over time

Missing:
  - How long do effects last? (turns, conditions, removal methods)
  - Can effects stack?
  - Immunity mechanics?

Proposed System:
  Status Effect Duration:
    - Stunned: 1-3 turns (based on damage dealt)
    - Panicked: Until morale restored (healing, leadership)
    - Burning: 3 turns or until extinguished (water, medkit)
    - Poisoned: 5 turns or until treated (antidote)
    - Bleeding: Permanent until healed (medkit required)
  
  Stacking Rules:
    - Same effect: Refreshes duration (doesn't stack)
    - Different effects: All apply simultaneously
    - Max 3 negative effects per unit (oldest removed)
```

**Recommended Solution**:

1. Create "Combat Formulas" section in Battlescape.md
2. Document all calculations explicitly
3. Add example combat scenarios with step-by-step math
4. Cross-reference with Items.md (weapon stats) and Units.md (unit stats)

---

### 7. Research Tree Lacks Strategic Depth (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Research progression is linear with minimal strategic choice.

**Evidence**:
- Research projects have prerequisites (linear chains)
- All tech trees eventually accessible (no mutually exclusive paths)
- No time pressure (aliens don't counter-research aggressively)
- Scientist allocation has diminishing returns (optimal: 5 per project, no more)

**Player Experience**:
- "Obvious" research order emerges (rush weapons → armor → advanced tech)
- No meaningful research tradeoffs (can research everything given time)
- Mid-game research becomes "waiting game" (no urgency)

**Recommended Solutions**:

1. **Add Branching Research Paths (High Priority)**
```yaml
Example: Early Weapon Research

Current (Linear):
  Basic Weapons → Advanced Weapons → Alien Weapons → Ultimate Weapons

Proposed (Branching):
  Basic Weapons → Choose ONE initial path:
    A) Energy Weapons Path
       - Laser Rifles (fast research, low damage, infinite ammo)
       - Plasma Weapons (expensive, high damage, alien tech required)
       - Dimensional Weapons (endgame, reality-warping effects)
    
    B) Kinetic Weapons Path
       - Gauss Rifles (mid research, balanced, standard ammo)
       - Railguns (expensive, armor-piercing, requires power)
       - Coilguns (endgame, perfect accuracy, high AP cost)
    
    C) Chemical Weapons Path
       - Poison Gas (fast, area denial, moral penalty)
       - Acid Launchers (mid, armor destruction, hazard)
       - Nanoweapons (endgame, persistent DoT, stealth)

Strategic Implication:
  - Path choice defines playstyle for 10+ missions
  - Can cross-research later but requires double time
  - Enemies adapt to player path (resistant armor after 5 uses)
  - Encourages replays with different paths
```

2. **Introduce Research Competition (Medium Priority)**
```yaml
Alien Counter-Research System:
  - Aliens analyze player tactics every 3 missions
  - After analysis: Unlock counter-tech (2 month delay)
  - Counter-tech effects:
    - Player uses lasers → Aliens develop reflective armor (-30% laser damage)
    - Player uses heavy armor → Aliens develop armor-piercing rounds (+50% penetration)
    - Player uses psionics → Aliens develop psi-shields (immune to mind control)

Player Response:
  - Intelligence missions reveal alien research in progress
  - Can prioritize counter-counter-tech (research to negate alien counter)
  - OR adapt tactics (switch weapon types, new strategy)
  - Creates dynamic arms race

Benefit:
  - Research feels reactive and urgent (not just waiting)
  - Player must adapt strategy mid-campaign
  - Prevents single-strategy dominance
```

3. **Limit Parallel Research (Low Priority)**
```yaml
Current: Can research unlimited projects simultaneously (scientist cap only)

Proposed: Research Facility Limits
  - Basic Lab: 3 active projects max
  - Advanced Lab: 5 active projects max
  - Research Complex: 8 active projects max

Effect:
  - Forces prioritization (can't research everything at once)
  - Strategic choice: Broad research vs. focused advancement
  - Makes facility upgrades meaningful (unlock more parallel tracks)

Benefit:
  - Creates opportunity cost (researching A means NOT researching B now)
  - Increases strategic depth without complexity
```

---

### 8. Interception Layer Lacks Tactical Depth (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem**: Interception is formulaic card-game combat with limited decision-making.

**Evidence**:
- Action: Fire weapon (hit chance calculation) → Wait for impact (turns delay) → Repeat
- No positioning mechanics (3 altitude sectors, 4 objects max per sector)
- Limited tactical options (fire, evade, retreat)
- No terrain/environment interaction (biome effects minimal)

**Player Feedback (Anticipated)**:
- "Interception feels like automated combat" (click and wait)
- "No skill expression" (optimal strategy obvious)
- "Skip-able layer" (players want to go straight to battlescape)

**Design Philosophy Question**:
- Is Interception intended as mini-game (quick resolution) or full tactical layer?
- If mini-game: Current design acceptable but needs faster pacing
- If tactical: Needs major depth additions (positioning, special abilities, environment)

**Recommended Solutions**:

**Option A: Embrace Mini-Game (Low Effort)**
```yaml
Changes:
  - Reduce turn duration: 5 turns max per interception (not 10-15)
  - Add "Auto-Resolve" option (calculate outcome based on stats, instant result)
  - Show cinematic replay after auto-resolve (satisfying visuals)
  - Benefit: Faster pacing, players focus on strategic deployment not tactical micro

When to Use:
  - Interception meant as strategic gate (qualify for battlescape)
  - Players primarily interested in ground combat
  - Development resources limited
```

**Option B: Add Tactical Depth (High Effort)**
```yaml
Positioning System:
  - 3D grid: 5×5 hex grid per altitude sector (not just 4 slots)
  - Movement: Crafts can reposition (2-4 hexes per turn)
  - Range mechanics: Optimal range for each weapon (damage falloff)
  - Flanking bonuses: Attacking from multiple angles (+20% accuracy)

Special Abilities:
  - Barrel Roll: +30% dodge for 1 turn, costs 2 AP
  - Missile Lock: +50% accuracy next shot, requires 2 turns setup
  - Boost: Move +4 hexes, -20% defense (aggressive positioning)
  - Cloak: Invisible for 2 turns, can't attack (setup ambush)

Environment Interaction:
  - Clouds: Provide cover (-20% enemy accuracy)
  - Storms: -30% accuracy for all units, +20% evasion
  - Terrain: Mountains block line of sight (tactical positioning)
  - Sun Position: Attacking from sun grants +15% accuracy (blind enemy)

Benefit: Deep tactical layer, skill expression, replayability
Cost: Significant development time, balance testing required

When to Use:
  - Interception is core gameplay pillar (not just gate)
  - Target audience enjoys tactical combat depth
  - Development resources available for polish
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (embrace mini-game), iterate to Option B if player feedback demands depth.

## Balance Tuning Recommendations (Specific Numbers)

### Unit XP Curve (Revised)
```yaml
Current → Proposed (% Change)
Rank 1: 100 → 100 (0%)
Rank 2: 300 → 250 (-17%)
Rank 3: 600 → 500 (-17%)
Rank 4: 1000 → 800 (-20%)
Rank 5: 1500 → 1200 (-20%)
Rank 6: 2100 → 1700 (-19%)

Reasoning: Makes Rank 4+ achievable within campaign (30-35 missions)
```

### Economic Values (Suggested)
```yaml
Manufacturing Cost Advantage:
Current: 30-50% cheaper than marketplace
Proposed: 20-30% cheaper (reduce dominance)

Marketplace Fluctuation:
Current: Stable prices
Proposed: ±15% weekly variance (creates buying opportunities)

Funding Volatility:
Current: Stable monthly funding
Proposed: ±20% monthly variance (unpredictable income)

Inflation Threshold:
Current: 20× monthly income
Proposed: Progressive (5×, 10×, 20× with increasing penalties)
```

### Research Times (Suggested)
```yaml
Basic Research:
Current: 50-150 man-days (1-3 months with 5 scientists)
Proposed: 30-100 man-days (0.6-2 months, faster iteration)

Advanced Research:
Current: 150-300 man-days (3-6 months)
Proposed: 100-200 man-days (2-4 months, maintains pacing)

Alien Research:
Current: 300-500 man-days (6-10 months)
Proposed: 200-350 man-days (4-7 months, more accessible)

Reasoning: Current research too slow for mid-game engagement
```

### Combat Balance (Suggested)
```yaml
Armor Effectiveness:
Kinetic Damage: 100% armor (full protection)
Energy Damage: 50% armor (lasers bypass some)
Explosive Damage: 25% armor (area effect)
Psionic Damage: 0% armor (mental attacks)
Hazard Damage: 75% armor (environmental)

Accuracy Modifiers:
Distance: -2% per hex beyond optimal range
Cover (Half): -20% hit chance
Cover (Full): -40% hit chance
Height Advantage: +10% hit chance
Movement Penalty: -30% (move), -50% (dash)
Flanking Bonus: +20% (no cover applies)

Status Effect Durations:
Stunned: 1-3 turns (damage-based)
Panicked: Until morale restored
Burning: 3 turns or extinguished
Poisoned: 5 turns or treated
Bleeding: Permanent until healed
```

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas (Requires Playtesting)

1. **Mid-Game Event Frequency**
   - Risk: Too many events = overwhelming, too few = still boring
   - Mitigation: Start conservative (1 event per 2 months), tune based on feedback
   - Playtest Metric: Track player engagement hours 20-40 (mid-game)

2. **Economic Scarcity Balance**
   - Risk: Too scarce = frustrating, not scarce enough = no impact
   - Mitigation: Implement progressive scarcity (month 1-3 easy, 4-6 moderate, 7+ tight)
   - Playtest Metric: Track player credit balance over time (should fluctuate, not grow infinitely)

3. **Research Path Exclusivity**
   - Risk: Players feel locked out of content, regret choices
   - Mitigation: Allow cross-research later (2× time cost), no permanent lockouts
   - Playtest Metric: Survey player satisfaction with research choices

### Low-Risk Areas (Safe Changes)

1. **Documentation Clarifications** - No gameplay impact, pure improvement
2. **XP Curve Reduction** - Makes content more accessible (universally positive)
3. **Combat Formula Documentation** - Essential for implementation consistency

## Next Steps (Action Plan)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Document combat formulas (damage, accuracy, status effects)
2. Rebalance unit XP curve (-17% to -20% across Ranks 2-6)
3. Clarify pilot system (role vs. class documentation fix)
4. Review Basescape grid decision (square vs. hex, document rationale)

### Phase 2: Economic Pressure (Weeks 3-4)
1. Implement resource scarcity (fuel capacity, material shortages)
2. Add manufacturing capacity limits (facility-based queue caps)
3. Implement progressive taxation (5×, 10×, 20× thresholds)
4. Add funding volatility (±20% monthly variance)

### Phase 3: Mid-Game Content (Weeks 5-7)
1. Design procedural event system (political, alien, scientific)
2. Implement divergent victory paths (4 strategies)
3. Create adaptive difficulty system (performance-based scaling)
4. Playtest and iterate (critical phase)

### Phase 4: Progression Systems (Weeks 8-9)
1. Implement weapon mastery system (+2% per 10 kills)
2. Add combat role specialization (aggressive/defensive/support)
3. Create pilot specialization tracks (fighter/bomber/transport/ace)
4. Add veteran mentorship (+50% XP catchup)

### Phase 5: Research Depth (Weeks 10-11)
1. Design branching research paths (3 paths per category)
2. Implement alien counter-research (adaptive enemy tech)
3. Add research facility limits (capacity-based)
4. Balance research times (reduce by 20-30%)

### Phase 6: Polish & Playtesting (Weeks 12-14)
1. Comprehensive balance pass (all systems)
2. External playtest (10-20 players, full campaign)
3. Iterate based on feedback (address pain points)
4. Final tuning (prepare for release)

## Conclusion

AlienFall has **exceptional design foundations** with comprehensive documentation and well-architected systems. The primary weaknesses are:

1. **Mid-game engagement** (months 4-8 lack compelling progression)
2. **Economic balance** (wealth spirals out of control, no pressure)
3. **Unit progression** (XP curve too steep, Rank 4+ unreachable)

These are **solvable design problems** with clear solutions. The recommended changes maintain the core design philosophy while adding strategic depth and maintaining player engagement throughout the campaign.

**Risk Level**: Medium (changes are substantial but well-defined)  
**Development Time**: 10-14 weeks (phased approach allows incremental delivery)  
**Impact**: High (addresses core player experience issues)

**Final Recommendation**: Prioritize Tier 1 Critical items (mid-game events, economic balance, combat formulas) before release. Tier 2-3 items can be added in post-launch updates based on player feedback.
