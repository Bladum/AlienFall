# Implementation Progress Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Task:** TASK-015 Battlescape Improvements

---

## ✅ PHASE A: Fire & Smoke System Integration - COMPLETE

### Files Created
- `engine/systems/battle/fire_system.lua` - Complete fire spreading, damage, smoke production
- `engine/systems/battle/smoke_system.lua` - 3-level smoke with dissipation

### Files Modified
- `engine/data/terrain_types.lua` - Added flammability (0.0-1.0) to all terrains
- `engine/modules/battlescape.lua` - Integrated fire/smoke systems, added visual rendering
- `engine/systems/action_system.lua` - Fire blocks movement
- `engine/systems/los_optimized.lua` - Fire (+3) and smoke (+2/level) visibility penalties

### Features Implemented
✅ Binary fire state (on/off)  
✅ Fire spreading based on flammability  
✅ Fire damages units (5 HP/turn)  
✅ Fire produces smoke in adjacent tiles  
✅ Fire blocks movement completely  
✅ Smoke 3 levels (light/medium/heavy)  
✅ Smoke spreads and dissipates  
✅ Smoke visibility penalties (+2 per level)  
✅ Smoke only on non-blocking tiles  
✅ Visual rendering (orange fire, gray smoke with alpha)  
✅ Turn system integration  
✅ LOS cache invalidation  

### Debug Controls
- **F6:** Start test fire at camera center
- **F7:** Clear all fires and smoke
- Fire flickers with animation
- Smoke opacity varies by level

## ✅ PHASE A: Bug Fixes - COMPLETE

### 1. Middle Mouse Button Panning ✅
- Smooth camera dragging
- State tracking (isDragging, dragStart)
- Works across entire battlefieldHex Map Block System - PARTIAL

### Files Created
- `engine/libs/toml.lua` - Basic TOML parser
- `engine/systems/battle/map_block.lua` - MapBlock class with TOML serialization
- `engine/systems/battle/mapblock_system.lua` - System architecture stub

### Features Implemented
✅ TOML parser (strings, numbers, booleans, tables)  
✅ MapBlock class (15x15 tiles)  
✅ TOML load/save  
✅ Default block generator (open, urban, forest)  
✅ Block library loading system  

### Still TODO
⏳ GridMap class (4x4 to 7x7 block arrangement)  
⏳ HexRotated coordinate system (45° rotation)  
⏳ Battlefield assembly from blocks  
⏳ 10-15 MapBlock TOML templates  
⏳ Battlescape integration  

**Estimated time to complete:** 4-6 hours

---

## 📊 Testing Status

### Ready to Test
✅ All bug fixes (middle mouse, debug grid, PNG export, LOS)  
✅ Fire and smoke system (F6 to start, F7 to clear)  
✅ Fire spreading on flammable terrain  
✅ Unit damage from fire  
✅ Smoke production and dissipation  
✅ Visual effects  

### Test Commands
```bash
lovec "engine"
```

**In-game tests:**
1. Press F9 - Verify fullscreen debug grid
2. Press F12 - Toggle fullscreen, check grid still covers screen
3. Middle mouse drag - Pan map smoothly
4. Press F5 - Export PNG to TEMP
5. Press F6 - Start fire at center
6. End turn several times - Watch fire spread
7. Observe smoke appearing around fire
8. Try moving unit into fire - Should be blocked
9. Check visibility through smoke - Should be reduced

### Needs Integration Testing
⏳ Hex map blocks (not yet integrated into battlescape)
