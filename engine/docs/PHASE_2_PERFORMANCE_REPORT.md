# Phase 2 Performance Optimization Report
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE - Target Exceeded!

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 focused on optimizing battlefield generation, the single largest bottleneck in battlescape initialization. Achieved **42.6x speedup** for map generation, bringing total battlescape init time from 314ms to **29ms** - far exceeding the 200ms target!

---

## Optimization 6: Battlefield Generation

### Problem Analysis:

Original battlefield generation (297ms) was the dominant bottleneck:
- Creating 8,100 tiles (90×90 map) with repeated `BattleTile.new()` calls
- Multiple passes over the same tiles (11 separate feature additions)
- Recreating tiles instead of updating terrain properties
- No profiling to identify which steps were slow

### Solution Implemented:

**Three-Phase Optimization:**

1. **Pre-Allocation** (6.410ms)
   - Create all 8,100 tiles in single pass with minimal terrain
   - Only borders set to walls initially
   - Eliminates redundant tile creation

2. **Batch Features** (0.224ms)
   - Group all features into data structure
   - Process in optimized loops
   - Update tile terrain properties instead of recreating tiles
   - Pre-cache terrain objects to avoid repeated lookups

3. **Efficient Paths** (0.080ms)
   - Apply paths last to avoid overwrites
   - Direct terrain property updates
   - Batch path tile updates

### Implementation Details:

```lua
-- BEFORE: Create new tile objects for each feature
self.map[y][x] = BattleTile.new("wall", x, y)  -- Recreates tile!

-- AFTER: Update existing tile properties
self.map[y][x].terrain = TerrainTypes.get("wall")  -- Reuses tile
self.map[y][x].terrainId = "wall"
```

**Key Optimizations:**
- Terrain object caching (`local wallTerrain = TerrainTypes.get("wall")`)
- Loop hoisting (pre-calculate bounds outside loops)
- Eliminated redundant bounds checks inside nested loops
- Feature batching (process all features of same type together)

### Performance Impact:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Battlefield Generation** | 297.439 ms | 6.978 ms | **42.6x faster** |
| - Base tiles | ~200ms (estimated) | 6.410 ms | ~31x faster |
| - Features | ~80ms (estimated) | 0.224 ms | ~357x faster |
| - Paths | ~17ms (estimated) | 0.080 ms | ~213x faster |
| **Total Battlescape Init** | 314.897 ms | 29.094 ms | **10.8x faster** |

### Console Output:

```
[Battlefield] Base tiles created: 6.410 ms ✅
[Battlefield] Features added: 0.224 ms ✅
[Battlefield] Paths added: 0.080 ms ✅
[Battlefield] Generated 90x90 map with features in 6.978 ms ✅

### Real-World Performance:

From actual gameplay session:
```
✅ Total battlescape init: 29.094 ms (Target: <200ms)
✅ Battlefield generation: 6.978 ms (was 297ms)
✅ LOS calculation: 3.295 ms for 14 units
✅ Visibility update after movement: 0.538 ms (1 dirty, 13 cached)
✅ Cache hit rate: 0% → 11.1% after 2 movements
✅ Dirty flags working: Only 1/14 units recalculated after move
```

## Code Quality

### Optimization Techniques Used:

1. **Pre-allocation** - Create all objects once
2. **Batch processing** - Group similar operations
3. **Property updates** - Reuse objects instead of recreating
4. **Object caching** - Cache terrain objects
5. **Loop optimization** - Hoist bounds checks
6. **Profiling** - Measure every optimization
7. **Dirty flags** - Skip unnecessary work
8. **Spatial hashing** - O(1) lookups

### Best Practices:

- Comprehensive profiling at each step
- Backward-compatible API (old methods still work)
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Maintains code readability
- No breaking changes

---

## Memory Impact

**Phase 2 Changes:**
- Memory usage: **~Same** (reusing tiles instead of creating new ones)
- GC pressure: **Reduced** (fewer object allocations)
- Cache size: **Unchanged** (battlefield generation doesn't affect LOS cache)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Optional)

### High Priority (If Needed):

1. **Incremental Visibility Updates** (only changed sectors)
   - Current: Still recalculating all moved units
   - Target: Only recalculate affected map sectors
   - Expected: Additional 2-5x speedup

2. **Pathfinding Optimization** (50+ tile paths)
   - Current: 73ms for very long paths
   - Target: < 10ms
   - Method: Jump point search, path caching

### Medium Priority:

3. **Visibility Sector Caching** (cache by map region)
4. **Unit LOD** (reduce processing for off-screen units)

### Not Needed Currently:

With 29ms init time, further optimization is optional. The system is **well under budget** and performs excellently.

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2 optimization successfully completed!** Battlefield generation optimized from 297ms to 7ms (42.6x faster), bringing total battlescape initialization to **29ms** - far exceeding the 200ms target.
