# Basescape Systems

## Goal / Purpose
High-level orchestration and integration layer for basescape functionality. Coordinates all basescape subsystems including bases, facilities, economy, and research into a cohesive gameplay experience.

## Content
- **System managers** - Orchestration of basescape functions
- **Event handlers** - Reactions to player actions and state changes
- **Integration points** - Connections between basescape subsystems
- **Update loops** - Periodic updates and tick-based operations
- **State coordination** - Management of overall basescape state

## Features
- Unified basescape interface
- Coordinated subsystem updates
- Event-driven architecture
- Efficient state management
- Modular system design

## Integrations with Other Folders / Systems
