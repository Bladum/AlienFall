--- Diplomatic AI System - Country faction decision-making
---
--- Handles AI decisions for country factions based on relations, player power,
--- country status, and strategic objectives. Makes decisions about offers,
--- demands, alliances, and missions.
---
--- Key Features:
--- - Country status evaluation (strong/stable/weak)
--- - Player power assessment
--- - Relations-based decision making
--- - Demand and offer generation
--- - Strategic diplomatic responses
---
--- Usage:
---   local Diplomat = require("engine.ai.diplomatic_ai")
---   local dipl = Diplomat:new()
---   local decision = dipl:makeDecision(country, game_state)
---   local action = dipl:respondToPlayerAction(country, action)
