## Game Design

For detailed game design information, see [GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md](GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md).

Key features:
- **Province Network**: 7 interconnected regions (like Risk)
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Action points, fog of war, tactical positioning
- **Base Management**: Build facilities, hire personnel, research technology
- **Economy**: Manage funds, monthly income/expenses, province satisfaction
- **Open-Ended**: No fixed win/loss conditions, sandbox gameplay

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New State**: Create a module in `modules/` and register it in `main.lua`
2. **New System**: Add utility code to `systems/`
3. **Game Data**: Define data structures in `data/`
4. **Assets**: Place images, sounds, fonts in `assets/`

### Code Style

- Use `local` for all variables
- CamelCase for functions: `calculateDamage()`
- UPPER_CASE for constants: `MAX_HEALTH`
- PascalCase for modules: `StateManager`
- 4-space indentation
- Meaningful comments for complex logic

### Testing

Run the game with console enabled (set in `conf.lua`) to see debug output:
- State transitions
- User actions
- Error messages

## Troubleshooting

**Game won't start:**
- Ensure Love2D 12.0 is installed
- Check that all required files are present
- Look for error messages in the console

**Performance issues:**
- Lower the map size in battlescape
- Reduce the number of units
- Check for excessive logging

**Controls not working:**
- Make sure the game window has focus
- Check for conflicting keyboard shortcuts
- Try clicking on different areas

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple bases
- Interception mini-game
- More alien types
- Campaign mode
- Modding support
- Multiplayer (hot-seat)
- Procedural map generation
- Advanced AI
