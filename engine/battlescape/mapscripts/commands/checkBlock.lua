---checkBlock - Map Script Command for Conditional Execution
---
---MapScript command that evaluates conditions for conditional command execution.
---Used in MapScript logic to create if-then-else structures and conditional block placement.
---The actual condition evaluation is handled by the MapScriptExecutor.
---
---Features:
---  - Conditional command execution control
---  - Integration with MapScript if-then-else logic
---  - No block placement (control flow only)
---  - Condition evaluation delegated to executor
---
---Key Exports:
---  - execute(context, cmd): Execute checkBlock command (condition evaluation)
---
---Command Parameters:
---  - Conditions are evaluated by the MapScriptExecutor based on script logic
---
---Dependencies:
---  - require("battlescape.mapscripts.mapscript_executor"): Command execution and condition evaluation

---@usage
---  -- Used internally by MapScriptExecutor for conditional logic
---  -- Not typically used directly in MapScript TOML files
---
---@see battlescape.mapscripts.mapscript_executor For condition evaluation logic

-- Map Script Command: checkBlock
-- Checks conditions for conditional execution

local MapScriptExecutor = require("battlescape.mapscripts.mapscript_executor")

local checkBlock = {}

---Execute checkBlock command
---@param context ExecutionContext Execution context
---@param cmd table Command parameters
---@return boolean success Whether command succeeded
function checkBlock.execute(context, cmd)
    -- This command doesn't place blocks, it's used for conditional logic
    -- The actual condition evaluation is handled by the executor
    
    print(string.format("[checkBlock] Condition check (handled by executor)"))
    return true
