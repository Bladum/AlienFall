# Architecture

## Goal / Purpose

The Architecture folder contains high-level design documentation, system integration diagrams, and technical roadmaps for the AlienFall project. It defines how major game systems interact with each other and the overall technical direction.

## Content

- **01-game-structure.md** - Core game structure, state management, and scene architecture
- **02-procedural-generation.md** - Map generation, procedural content creation algorithms
- **03-combat-tactics.md** - Tactical combat system design and turn mechanics
- **04-base-economy.md** - Base management and economic simulation systems
- **INTEGRATION_FLOW_DIAGRAMS.md** - Visual diagrams showing system interactions and data flow
- **ROADMAP.md** - Technical roadmap, planned features, and development phases

## Features

- **System Architecture**: How major systems (Geoscape, Battlescape, Basescape) are structured
- **Integration Patterns**: How systems communicate and share data
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of information flow between systems
- **State Management**: Game state transitions and lifecycle
- **Performance Considerations**: Design decisions for optimization
- **Scalability**: Support for large maps, many units, complex AI
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports modding and custom content

## Integrations with Other Systems

### Engine Implementation
- `engine/` structure mirrors architecture organization
- Core systems (state_manager, assets, data_loader) implement architectural patterns
- Each module in `engine/` follows layered architecture

### Design Specifications
- Design documents in `design/mechanics/` detail individual systems
- Architecture provides overall structure for those systems
- Gaps documented in `design/gaps/`

### API Documentation
- API files in `api/` define contracts for architectural layers
- Configuration formats support architectural patterns
- Integration points listed in `api/INTEGRATION.md`

### Testing & Validation
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` validate architecture
- System tests verify component interactions
- Performance tests ensure architectural efficiency

### Roadmap Planning
- Technical roadmap guides development priorities
- Identifies areas needing architectural changes
- Tracks long-term technical debt and refactoring

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**: GUI, rendering, input
- **Game Logic Layer**: State management, game rules
- **System Layer**: Core systems (AI, pathfinding, economy)
- **Data Layer**: Assets, configurations, persistence

### State Machine
- Game manages state transitions (menu → geoscape → battlescape, etc.)
- Each state has update/draw lifecycle
- Smooth transitions between game modes

### ECS (Entity Component System)
- Battlescape uses ECS for efficient combat simulation
- Entities have components for behavior, rendering, collision
- Systems process components for game logic

### Event-Driven
- Systems communicate via events where appropriate
- Decouples systems and enables mod integration
- Enables async operations and animations
