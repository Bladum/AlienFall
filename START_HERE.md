## 💡 Key Findings From Analysis

### Problem Identified:
- Design docs scattered → wiki/systems/, docs/, geoscape/
- API specs duplicated → wiki/api/ + docs/mods/toml_schemas/
- Engine GUI fragmented → scenes/, ui/, widgets/ (3 separate folders)
- No temp folder → agent outputs clutter project
- No lore folder → creative assets unorganized

### Solution Provided:
```
design/        ← Pure game mechanics
   ↓
api/           ← TOML schema documentation
   ↓
architecture/  ← Implementation guides
   ↓
engine/        ← Lua game code
   ↓
mods/          ← TOML game content
   ↓
tests/         ← Unit & integration tests
   ↓
tools/         ← Development utilities
   ↓
tasks/         ← AI Agent task tracking
   ↓
temp/          ← Temporary files (NEW)
   ↓
lore/          ← Creative assets (NEW)
```

### Recommendation:
**Go with PATH B: Staged Rollout**
- Phase 1: Create structure (1h)
- Phase 2: Move docs (2-3h)
- Phase 3: Consolidate GUI (3-4h)
- Phase 4: Cleanup (1-2h)
- Total: 8-10 hours, done over multiple sessions
