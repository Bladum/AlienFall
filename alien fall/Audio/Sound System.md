# Sound System

## Overview
The sound system manages all audio elements including sound effects, music, and ambient audio to create immersive gameplay experiences. Contextual audio cues provide feedback for game events, enhance atmosphere, and improve user experience. The system supports spatial audio, dynamic mixing, and resource-efficient playback.

## Mechanics
- Spatial audio positioning for 3D sound environments
- Dynamic volume controls and audio mixing
- Resource management for memory-efficient loading
- Event-driven audio triggering and queuing
- Music state management and transitions
- Audio format support (WAV, OGG, MP3)

## Examples
| Audio Type | Trigger | Effect | Technical Feature |
|------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Combat SFX | Weapon fire | Immersion | Spatial positioning |
| UI Sounds | Button clicks | Feedback | Instant playback |
| Ambient Audio | Environment | Atmosphere | Looping with variation |
| Music | Mission start | Tension | Dynamic transitions |
