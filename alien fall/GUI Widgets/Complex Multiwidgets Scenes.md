# Complex Multiwidgets Scenes

## Overview
Complex multiwidgets combine multiple basic widgets into sophisticated interface components for advanced UI scenarios. These composite elements enable modular construction of complex screens while supporting theme integration and mod extensibility.

## Mechanics
- Widget composition and nesting
- Panel and container management
- Tabbed interface support
- Scrollable content areas
- Specialized game widgets (minimap, action bars)
- Mod-extensible widget registration
- Theme and styling integration

## Examples
| Multiwidget Type | Component Widgets | Functionality | Use Case |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Character Sheet | Panels, buttons, lists | Unit management | Barracks interface |
| Research Screen | Tabs, progress bars, tooltips | Tech advancement | Laboratory UI |
