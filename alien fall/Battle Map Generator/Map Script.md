# Map Script

## Overview
Map scripts define the procedural generation logic for assembling map blocks into complete map grids. Using conditional statements and specialized commands, they control block placement order, terrain connectivity, and strategic element distribution to create balanced and varied battlefields.

## Mechanics
- Conditional logic (IF/THEN/ELSE)
- Block placement sequencing
- Road generation (horizontal, vertical, intersections)
- Flood fill algorithms for area coverage
- Terrain connectivity validation
- Mission type integration

## Examples
| Script Command | Purpose | Parameters | Result |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------|
| PLACE_BLOCK | Add terrain | Block type, position | Specific feature placement |
| GENERATE_ROAD | Connectivity | Direction, length | Road network creation |
| FLOOD_FILL | Area coverage | Terrain type, bounds | Terrain area filling |
| IF_CONDITION | Logic control | Mission type check | Conditional generation |
