# Map Prefab

## Overview
Map prefabs are predefined small 2D arrays of map tiles that can be reused across multiple map blocks. They represent common terrain features like buildings, vehicles, or natural elements, enabling consistent and efficient map generation while maintaining visual variety.

## Mechanics
- Variable size 2D tile arrays
- Reusable across different map blocks
- Common terrain feature templates
- Randomization options for variety
- Integration with tileset graphics
- Performance optimization through reuse

## Examples
| Prefab Type | Size | Contents | Usage Frequency |
|-------------|------|----------|-----------------|
| Small House | 3x3 | Walls, door, windows | High |
| Vehicle Wreck | 2x4 | Car body, debris | Medium |
| Tree Cluster | 2x2 | Multiple trees | High |
| Crater | 1x1 | Impact damage | Low |
