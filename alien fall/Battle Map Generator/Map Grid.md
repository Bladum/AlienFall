# Map Grid

## Overview
The map grid is a 2D array of assembled map blocks created according to map script instructions. This intermediate structure allows for mission objective integration, landing zone selection, and strategic value assignment before final conversion to the battle grid.

## Mechanics
- 2D array of connected map blocks
- Mission objective integration
- Landing zone identification and assignment
- Strategic value calculation per block
- Connectivity validation
- Pre-battle tactical planning support

## Examples
| Grid Configuration | Block Count | Landing Zones | Strategic Focus |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Compact Urban | 4x4 (16 blocks) | 2 zones | Close-quarters combat |
| Sprawling Rural | 6x6 (36 blocks) | 3 zones | Long-range engagements |
| Mixed Terrain | 5x5 (25 blocks) | 4 zones | Combined arms tactics |
