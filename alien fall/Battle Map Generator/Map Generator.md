# Map Generator

## Overview
The map generator is a comprehensive system that processes terrain types, mission parameters, and map scripts to create complete battle grids. It orchestrates the entire map creation pipeline from initial terrain selection through final battlescape assembly, ensuring balanced and engaging tactical environments.

## Mechanics
- Terrain type analysis and selection
- Mission size and objective integration
- Map script execution and block placement
- Connectivity and pathfinding validation
- Objective placement and landing zone assignment
- Environmental effect distribution
- Balance checking and adjustments

## Examples
| Generation Phase | Input | Process | Output |
|------------------|-------|---------|--------|
| Terrain Selection | Mission type | Biome analysis | Terrain palette |
| Block Assembly | Map script | Conditional placement | Map grid |
| Finalization | Objectives | Landing zone selection | Complete battle grid |
