# Karma System

## Overview
The Karma System tracks the moral and ethical implications of player actions throughout the game. It affects reputation, funding availability, and unlocks different gameplay paths, providing meaningful consequences for controversial decisions.

## Mechanics
- **Karma Points**: Earned or lost based on mission outcomes and strategic choices
- **Alignment Spectrum**: Ranges from heroic to ruthless, affecting available options
- **Funding Impacts**: Countries may adjust funding based on perceived morality
- **Mission Availability**: Certain missions only available to specific karma alignments
- **Long-term Consequences**: Karma affects endgame scenarios and relationships
- **Redemption/Decline**: Actions can gradually shift karma over time

## Examples
| Karma Level | Points Range | Effects |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Saintly | 1000+ | Maximum funding, heroic missions |
| Virtuous | 500-999 | Good relations, positive events |
| Neutral | -499 to 499 | Standard gameplay, balanced options |
| Questionable | -500 to -999 | Reduced funding, mixed missions |
| Ruthless | -1000+ | Aggressive funding, dark missions |
