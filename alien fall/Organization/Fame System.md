# Fame System

## Overview
The Fame System tracks public recognition and media influence, rewarding successful missions and strategic achievements. High fame levels unlock diplomatic options, special events, and enhanced relationships with countries and organizations.

## Mechanics
- **Fame Points**: Earned through mission success, base defense, and strategic victories
- **Fame Levels**: Progress from unknown to legendary status
- **Media Influence**: Affects public perception and diplomatic relations
- **Diplomatic Bonuses**: Higher fame unlocks better country relations and funding
- **Special Events**: Fame thresholds trigger unique story events and opportunities
- **Decay Over Time**: Fame gradually decreases if not maintained through achievements
