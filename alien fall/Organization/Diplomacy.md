# Diplomacy

## Overview
Diplomacy manages relationships with human countries, corporate suppliers, and enemy factions. These relationships directly impact mission availability, funding levels, and marketplace access, creating strategic depth in the geoscape layer of gameplay.

## Mechanics
- **Country Relations**: Determines funding levels and mission access in specific regions
- **Faction Relations**: Controls activation/deactivation of missions and campaigns
- **Supplier Relations**: Affects marketplace availability and pricing
- **Relation Levels**: Range from hostile to allied, with corresponding benefits/penalties
- **Event Impacts**: Diplomatic events can change relations positively or negatively
- **Long-term Effects**: Sustained good relations unlock better opportunities over time

## Examples
| Entity Type | Relation Level | Effects |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Country | Allied | Maximum funding, all missions available |
| Country | Neutral | Standard funding, limited missions |
| Country | Hostile | Reduced funding, restricted access |
| Supplier | Trusted | Best prices, exclusive items |
| Faction | Friendly | Cooperative missions, shared intelligence |
| Faction | Hostile | Aggressive campaigns, increased difficulty |
