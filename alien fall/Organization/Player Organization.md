# Player Organization

## Overview
The Player Organization represents the growth and progression of the player's anti-alien organization. Through research and achievements, players unlock higher organization levels that provide access to advanced facilities, missions, and strategic capabilities.

## Mechanics
- **Organization Levels**: 4-5 levels in basic game, unlocked through research milestones
- **Level Requirements**: Each level requires specific research breakthroughs
- **Facility Unlocks**: Higher levels enable construction of advanced base facilities
- **Mission Access**: New campaign types and mission difficulties become available
- **Policy Points**: Each level upgrade grants one point for policy sliders
- **Strategic Depth**: Organization level affects available strategic options

## Examples
| Level | Research Required | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Initial | Basic facilities, standard missions |
| 2 | Alien Technology | Advanced labs, interception capabilities |
| 3 | Psionic Research | Psi training, special operations |
| 4 | Dimensional Studies | Portal research, elite units |
