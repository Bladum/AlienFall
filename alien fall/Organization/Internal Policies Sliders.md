# Internal Policies Sliders

## Overview
Internal Policies Sliders allow players to adjust organizational settings that affect various gameplay mechanics. These sliders control aggression levels, research focus, and operational priorities, impacting funding, morale, and strategic outcomes throughout the game.

## Mechanics
- **Policy Points**: Earned by upgrading organization level, spent to adjust sliders
- **Monthly Changes**: Policies can be adjusted once per month (up or down)
- **Cost Multipliers**: Each slider level applies percentage modifiers to various costs
- **Research Focus**: Affects research speed and available technologies
- **Aggression Level**: Impacts mission difficulty and enemy behavior
- **Operational Priorities**: Balances between offense, defense, and economy

## Examples
| Policy Slider | Level Range | Effects |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Research Cost | 0-10 | 10% cost reduction per level |
| Manufacturing Cost | 0-10 | 10% cost reduction per level |
| Promotion Cost | 0-10 | 10% cost reduction per level |
| Relationship Cost | 0-10 | 10% cost reduction per level |
| Facility Cost | 0-10 | 10% cost reduction per level |
| Marketplace Price | 0-10 | 10% price adjustment per level |

*Note: At marketplace level 5, buy/sell prices are balanced (sell at 50% of buy price)
