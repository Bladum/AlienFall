# List of Tiles

## Overview
The List of Tiles defines the ground textures and floor types available for specific terrain types during map generation. These tiles create the foundation of battlefields, affecting movement, cover, and visual consistency across different environments.

## Mechanics
- **Terrain Association**: Tiles matched to appropriate biomes and terrain types
- **Movement Effects**: Different tiles affect unit speed and traversal
- **Cover Properties**: Tiles provide varying levels of protection
- **Visual Continuity**: Seamless transitions between tile types
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering of large tile grids
- **Destruction Effects**: Tiles can show damage and environmental changes

## Examples
| Terrain Type | Tile Types | Properties |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Urban | Concrete, Asphalt, Grass | Hard surfaces, variable traction |
| Forest | Dirt, Grass, Mud | Soft ground, weather effects |
| Desert | Sand, Rock, Gravel | Loose surfaces, visibility impacts |
| Industrial | Metal, Concrete, Grating | Slippery, conductive properties |
| Mountain | Stone, Snow, Ice | Rough terrain, climbing requirements |
