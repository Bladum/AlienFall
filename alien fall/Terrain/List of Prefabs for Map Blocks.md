# List of Prefabs for Map Blocks

## Overview
The List of Prefabs for Map Blocks contains pre-built small terrain elements used for rapid map assembly. These include common structures like houses, vehicles, and environmental features that can be quickly placed to create detailed, consistent battlefields.

## Mechanics
- **Modular Design**: Prefabs can be combined to create complex terrain
- **Performance Optimized**: Pre-calculated collision and rendering data
- **Destructible Elements**: Some prefabs support damage and destruction
- **Interactive Features**: Doors, containers, and functional objects
- **Thematic Consistency**: Prefabs match terrain type and biome
- **Memory Efficient**: Shared assets reduce memory footprint

## Examples
| Category | Prefab Types | Uses |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Structures | Houses, Sheds, Walls | Cover and building interiors |
| Vehicles | Cars, Trucks, Tanks | Obstacles and interactive elements |
| Environmental | Trees, Rocks, Fences | Natural terrain features |
| Industrial | Crates, Pipes, Machinery | Urban and facility settings |
| Military | Barriers, Sandbags, Bunkers | Defensive positions |
