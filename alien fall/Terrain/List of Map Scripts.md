# List of Map Scripts

## Overview
The List of Map Scripts defines which procedural generation scripts can be applied to specific terrain types during map creation. These scripts control the placement of objectives, enemy positions, and special features, ensuring each mission feels unique while maintaining thematic consistency.

## Mechanics
- **Terrain Compatibility**: Scripts designed for specific terrain characteristics
- **Objective Placement**: Determines spawn points for goals and key locations
- **Enemy Distribution**: Controls AI unit positioning and patrol routes
- **Feature Integration**: Adds terrain-specific interactive elements
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Scripts adapt based on mission parameters
- **Replayability**: Random elements ensure varied experiences

## Examples
| Terrain Type | Script Types | Effects |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Urban | Ambush, Defense, Rescue | Building-based objectives, rooftop access |
| Forest | Search, Pursuit, Survival | Hidden objectives, environmental hazards |
| Desert | Escort, Assault, Recon | Open terrain tactics, extreme conditions |
| Mountain | Infiltration, Sabotage, Extraction | Verticality, difficult access routes |
| Swamp | Investigation, Containment, Evacuation | Hazardous terrain, mobility challenges |
