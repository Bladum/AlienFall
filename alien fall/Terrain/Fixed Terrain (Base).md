# Fixed Terrain (Base)

## Overview
Fixed Terrain maps provide predetermined layouts for critical missions such as base defense scenarios. These handcrafted maps ensure consistent strategic challenges and allow for precise control over defensive positioning and tactical objectives.

## Mechanics
- **Handcrafted Layouts**: Carefully designed terrain for specific mission types
- **Strategic Positioning**: Pre-placed cover, chokepoints, and defensive positions
- **Consistent Challenges**: Reliable difficulty and objectives for base defense
- **Environmental Integration**: Terrain features support mission narrative
- **Mod Support**: Fixed maps can be overridden or extended by mods
- **Performance Optimization**: Pre-calculated paths and visibility for better performance

## Examples
| Mission Type | Terrain Features | Strategic Elements |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Base Defense | Facility buildings, perimeter walls | Guard towers, access points |
| Crash Site | Wreckage, debris fields | Salvage objectives, alien threats |
| Research Outpost | Lab buildings, containment areas | Scientific equipment, security zones |
| Command Center | Control rooms, communication arrays | High-value targets, escape routes |
