# Tactical Features

## Overview
Tactical Features are terrain elements that directly impact combat mechanics and strategic positioning. These include cover objects, elevation changes, and movement modifiers that create dynamic tactical opportunities and challenges during battlescape missions.

## Mechanics
- **Cover System**: Objects provide protection from enemy fire
- **Elevation Advantages**: Height differences affect line of sight and attacks
- **Movement Modifiers**: Terrain affects unit speed and maneuverability
- **Interactive Elements**: Destructible or usable terrain features
- **Line of Sight**: Terrain blocks or enables visibility between units
- **Strategic Positioning**: Features create chokepoints and defensive positions

## Examples
| Feature Type | Tactical Effect | Strategic Use |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Low Wall | Partial cover, blocks movement | Defensive positioning, flanking routes |
| Elevated Platform | Height advantage, overwatch | Sniper positions, area control |
| Dense Vegetation | Concealment, movement penalty | Ambush setups, stealth approaches |
| Destructible Crate | Temporary cover, resource drops | Dynamic battlefield changes |
| Water Feature | Movement barrier, visibility effects | Terrain-based separation |
