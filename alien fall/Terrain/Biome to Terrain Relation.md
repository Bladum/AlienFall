# Biome to Terrain Relation

## Overview
The Biome to Terrain Relation system establishes connections between world biomes and specific terrain characteristics. This system defines how environmental factors affect gameplay mechanics, visuals, and mission outcomes, creating diverse and strategically varied mission settings.

## Mechanics
- **Biome Classification**: Categorizes world regions by climate and geography
- **Terrain Generation**: Maps biomes to specific terrain types and features
- **Environmental Effects**: Defines weather, visibility, and movement modifiers
- **Strategic Variety**: Different biomes create unique tactical challenges
- **Visual Consistency**: Ensures terrain matches regional biome characteristics
- **Mission Adaptation**: Missions adapt difficulty and objectives based on biome

## Examples
| Biome Type | Terrain Types | Gameplay Effects |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Desert | Sand, Rocks, Canyons | Extreme heat, poor cover, long sight lines |
| Forest | Trees, Undergrowth, Rivers | Concealment, restricted movement, ambush potential |
| Urban | Buildings, Streets, Parks | Verticality, cover variety, civilian presence |
| Mountain | Cliffs, Caves, Snow | Height advantages, difficult access, weather effects |
| Swamp | Mud, Water, Vegetation | Movement penalties, disease risks, limited visibility |
