# Interception Turn System

## Overview
The Interception Turn System handles operational combat between crafts in various environments, using round-based turns to manage engagements. Each turn spans approximately 60 seconds of real-time action, allowing crafts to maneuver, use weapons, and engage targets. This system integrates with the Action Point System and Energy Pool System for crafts, supporting diverse theaters of operation.

## Mechanics
- **Turn Duration**: Approximately 60 seconds per turn for operational pacing.
- **Craft Actions**: Movement, item usage, engagement with other crafts, UFOs, sites, or bases.
- **Environments**: Supports air, land, underwater, and underground combat scenarios.
- **Integration**: Uses AP for action limits and Energy Pool for fuel and endurance.
- **Objectives**: Intercept UFOs, defend bases, or conduct raids.

## Examples

Turn Sequence:
1. Movement Phase: Position crafts within range.
2. Action Phase: Fire weapons, deploy countermeasures.
3. Resolution: Calculate hits, damage, energy consumption.
4. End Turn: Regenerate energy, reset AP.

Scenario: A fighter craft moves into position (2 AP), fires missiles (1 AP), and evades (1 AP), depleting its energy pool.
