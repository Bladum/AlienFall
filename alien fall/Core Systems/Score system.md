# Score System

## Overview
The Score System evaluates player performance in missions, affecting relationships with countries and funding opportunities. Unlike Fame, Score is tied to tangible results in specific provinces, influencing diplomatic and economic ties. This public metric rewards effective operations while penalizing failures.

## Mechanics
- **Performance Basis**: Calculated from mission outcomes, casualties, and objectives in provinces.
- **Country Relations**: Positive score improves funding for protection; negative score reduces support.
- **Scope**: Localized to provinces; internal achievements like research don't affect it.
- **Visibility**: Publicly visible, impacting global reputation indirectly.

## Examples

Score Impacts:
- Successful UFO interception: +50 score in province
- Civilian casualties: -30 score
- Base defense success: +40 score

Scenario: High scores in key provinces secure increased funding, enabling expanded operations.
