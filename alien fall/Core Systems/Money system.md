# Money System

## Overview
The Money System, denominated in credits, serves as the primary currency for purchasing equipment, funding operations, and limiting player activities. Credits are earned through missions, sales, and funding, while spent on bases, research, and supplies. This economic layer adds resource management depth to the game.

## Mechanics
- **Currency Unit**: Credits (formerly referred to as 34K for internal consistency).
- **Income Sources**: Mission rewards, item sales, government funding, research payouts.
- **Expenditure**: Base construction, facility maintenance, equipment purchases, salaries.
- **Limitations**: Insufficient funds restrict operations, forcing prioritization.
- **Integration**: Ties into Fame and Karma systems for funding opportunities.

## Examples

Credit Flow:
- Mission Completion: +5000 credits
- Base Maintenance: -2000 credits/month
- Equipment Purchase: -10000 credits

Scenario: A player earns 15000 credits from UFO interceptions but spends 12000 on new facilities, maintaining a surplus for emergencies.
