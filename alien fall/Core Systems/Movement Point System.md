# Movement Point System

## Overview
The Movement Point (MP) System regulates unit mobility during battlescape combat, calculated from unit speed and available Action Points. It governs positioning and tactical movement across varied terrain, integrating with the Action Point System for cohesive action economy. This system ensures balanced unit capabilities and strategic depth in positioning.

## Mechanics
- **MP Calculation**: MP = unit speed Ã— available AP, resetting each turn.
- **Rotation Cost**: Turning 90 degrees costs 1 MP.
- **Terrain Costs**: Normal terrain: 2 MP (straight), 3 MP (diagonal); rough terrain: 4 MP (straight), 6 MP (diagonal).
- **Integration**: Movement consumes both MP and AP simultaneously.
- **Action Limits**: Non-movement actions primarily cost AP, with MP reserved for positioning.

## Examples

Movement Costs Table:

| Terrain Type | Straight Move | Diagonal Move | Rotation |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Normal | 2 MP | 3 MP | 1 MP |
| Rough | 4 MP | 6 MP | 1 MP |

Scenario: A unit with speed 2 and 4 AP has 8 MP. Moving 2 straight tiles (4 MP) and rotating (1 MP) leaves 3 MP, allowing further actions.
