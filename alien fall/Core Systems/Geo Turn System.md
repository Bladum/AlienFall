# Geo Turn System

## Overview
The Geo Turn System governs the strategic layer of gameplay, managing time progression across the world map and provinces. Each turn represents one day, allowing for long-term planning of base operations, mission assignments, and resource management. This system provides the overarching timeline for geoscape activities, integrating with interception and base management systems.

## Mechanics
- **Turn Duration**: One turn equals one day in game time.
- **Time Progression**: Weeks consist of 6 days; months comprise 5 weeks, creating a structured calendar.
- **Activities**: Players manage bases, assign crafts to missions, conduct research, and monitor global events.
- **Integration**: Links to Interception Turn System for operational combat and Mission Cover System for event detection.

## Examples

Time Flow:
- Day 1-6: Week 1 activities (missions, base construction).
- Day 7: Week transition, monthly reports.
- Month 1: 30 days (5 weeks Ã— 6 days), triggering economic cycles.

Scenario: Over 5 days, a player builds a facility, assigns crafts to patrols, and detects a UFO mission on day 5.
