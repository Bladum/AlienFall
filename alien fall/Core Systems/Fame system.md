# Fame System

## Overview
The Fame System tracks the player's public recognition and notoriety across the world, influencing available missions and marketplace opportunities. Fame increases through visible actions regardless of morality, creating strategic trade-offs between overt operations and covert activities. High fame favors aggressive strategies, while low fame enables stealthy approaches.

## Mechanics
- **Accumulation**: Fame rises from public actions, missions, and media coverage, independent of good/evil alignment.
- **Strategic Impact**: High fame unlocks open warfare missions and premium marketplace options; low fame favors covert operations and black market deals.
- **Balance**: Players must balance fame levels to access desired content without restricting options.
- **Integration**: Affects mission availability and economic interactions on the geoscape.

## Examples

Fame Levels and Effects:

| Fame Level | Description | Benefits | Drawbacks |

| Medium | Known entity | Balanced options | Some restrictions |
| High | Global figure | Elite missions, alliances | Attracts attention |

Scenario: Completing a high-profile UFO interception boosts fame, unlocking celebrity endorsements but alerting alien forces.
