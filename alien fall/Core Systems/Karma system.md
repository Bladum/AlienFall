# Karma System

## Overview
The Karma System tracks the player's moral alignment based on internal actions and decisions throughout the game, independent of public perception. It influences available missions and marketplace options, rewarding consistent ethical or unethical behavior. This hidden system encourages players to role-play their commander's philosophy.

## Mechanics
- **Alignment Tracking**: Karma shifts based on choices like sparing civilians, using experimental weapons, or allying with factions.
- **Hidden Nature**: Unaffected by public awareness; purely internal to the player's decisions.
- **Consequences**: High karma unlocks benevolent missions; low karma enables ruthless operations.
- **Integration**: Affects geoscape opportunities and narrative branches.

## Examples

Karma Events:
- Rescuing civilians: +Karma
- Using alien tech on humans: -Karma
