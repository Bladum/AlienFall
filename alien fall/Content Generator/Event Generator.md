# Event Generator

## Overview
The event generator creates dynamic in-game events that affect campaign progression, player choices, and world state. It produces random and scripted occurrences with consequences for diplomacy, economy, and military situations. Events add unpredictability and replayability to campaigns.

## Mechanics
- Event trigger condition definition
- Consequence and outcome generation
- Probability and timing controls
- Player choice integration
- World state modification
- Narrative integration

## Examples
| Event Type | Triggers | Consequences | Player Options |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Diplomatic Crisis | Low country funding | Reduced income, missions | Negotiation, military action |
| Technological Breakthrough | Research completion | New capabilities | Implementation choices |
| Alien Incursion | Random timer | New missions, threats | Response strategy |
