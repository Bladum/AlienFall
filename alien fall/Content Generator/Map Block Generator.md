# Map Block Generator

## Overview
The map block generator creates modular terrain sections that combine to form complete battlefields. It defines terrain types, cover objects, and strategic features for diverse mission layouts. This tool enables varied tactical environments and replayability.

## Mechanics
- Terrain type and feature definition
- Cover and elevation generation
- Strategic point placement
- Connectivity and pathfinding validation
- Environmental effect configuration
- Size and complexity scaling

## Examples
| Block Type | Terrain Features | Tactical Elements | Strategic Value |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Urban | Buildings, streets | Cover, chokepoints | Close-quarters combat |
| Rural | Fields, forests | Open spaces, concealment | Long-range engagements |
| Industrial | Factories, machinery | Complex cover, hazards | Complex navigation |
