# Engine Tests

## Overview
Engine tests validate the core functionality and stability of all game systems and subsystems. They ensure that the game engine operates correctly under various conditions and that all components work together seamlessly. These tests catch regressions and maintain system reliability.

## Mechanics
- System initialization testing
- Component interaction validation
- State management verification
- Error condition handling
- Resource management checks
- Integration testing across systems

## Examples
| Test Category | Focus | Validation | Importance |
|---------------|-------|------------|------------|
| Core Systems | Action Points, Energy Pools | Functionality | Critical |
| UI Systems | Widgets, GUI | Rendering, interaction | High |
| Game Logic | Battlescape, Geoscape | Rules, balance | Critical |
