# Mod Tests

## Overview
Mod tests validate the loading, execution, and safety of custom content and modifications. They ensure that mods integrate properly with the game without causing crashes or exploits. These tests maintain the security and stability of the modding ecosystem.

## Mechanics
- Mod loading verification
- Script execution testing
- Content validation
- Security sandbox checking
- Dependency resolution testing
- Error isolation and reporting

## Examples
| Test Type | Focus | Validation | Safety Measure |
|-----------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Load Testing | Mod initialization | Clean loading | Crash prevention |
| Execution Testing | Script running | Proper execution | Exploit blocking |
| Content Testing | Custom assets | Format compliance | Compatibility |
