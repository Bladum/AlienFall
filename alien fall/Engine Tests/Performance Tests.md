# Performance Tests

## Overview
Performance tests measure and optimize game speed, memory usage, and resource efficiency. They identify bottlenecks and ensure smooth gameplay across different hardware configurations. These tests maintain the game's technical performance standards.

## Mechanics
- Frame rate monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- CPU utilization measurement
- Load time benchmarking
- Scalability testing
- Bottleneck identification

## Examples
| Test Type | Metric | Target | Optimization |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Frame Rate | FPS | 60+ | Rendering optimization |
| Memory | RAM usage | <500MB | Asset management |
| Load Times | Startup time | <10s | Initialization streamlining |
| CPU | Utilization | <80% | Algorithm efficiency |
