# Item Durability

## Overview
Items are generally non-consumable, using an energy system instead of ammo. Thrown items have long cooldowns, and items are durable except for explosive destruction.

## Mechanics
- **Non-Consumable**: No ammo.
- **Energy System**: For usage.
- **Cooldowns**: Thrown items.
- **Destruction**: Explosions only.

## Examples
