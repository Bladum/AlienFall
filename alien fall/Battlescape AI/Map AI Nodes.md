# Map AI Nodes

## Overview
Map AI nodes serve as decision points that control enemy unit behavior and responses throughout battles. These nodes create adaptive AI that can react to player tactics, environmental changes, and mission objectives with varied and challenging responses.

## Mechanics
- Decision tree evaluation
- Behavior state transitions
- Trigger condition monitoring
- Priority-based action selection
- Context-aware response generation
- Learning from player patterns

## Examples
| Node Type | Trigger Conditions | Possible Actions | Adaptation Level |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Combat Engagement | Player in range | Attack, take cover, retreat | High |
| Reinforcement Call | Unit casualties | Spawn reserves, change formation | Medium |
| Objective Focus | Mission progress | Advance, defend, sabotage | High |
| Environmental Response | Hazard activation | Evacuate, exploit, avoid | Low |
