# Map Exploration

## Overview
Map exploration AI handles enemy pathfinding and navigation through unknown or fogged areas of the battlefield. This system enables dynamic threat discovery, ambush positioning, and adaptive patrol patterns that reveal hidden dangers as combat progresses.

## Mechanics
- Fog of war navigation
- Hidden threat detection
- Patrol route generation
- Ambush point identification
- Exploration priority assignment
- Discovery event triggering

## Examples
| Exploration Pattern | AI Behavior | Discovery Method | Risk Level |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Systematic Sweep | Grid-based coverage | Progressive reveal | Low |
| Random Patrol | Unpredictable movement | Chance encounters | Medium |
| Objective-Driven | Direct path to goals | Intentional search | High |
| Reactive Search | Response to noise/clues | Stimulus-based | Variable |
