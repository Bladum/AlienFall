# Battle Map Movement

## Overview
Battle map movement AI controls enemy unit positioning and pathfinding during tactical combat. This system optimizes movement patterns for flanking maneuvers, cover seeking, and strategic positioning to create challenging and adaptive enemy behavior.

## Mechanics
- Pathfinding algorithms for optimal routes
- Cover assessment and positioning
- Flanking opportunity identification
- Formation maintenance during movement
- Terrain cost evaluation
- Collision avoidance and coordination

## Examples
| Movement Type | AI Behavior | Tactical Purpose | Trigger Conditions |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Flanking | Wide arcs around player | Attack from side/rear | Exposed player position |
| Cover Seeking | Move to high-cover tiles | Protection during advance | Under fire |
| Formation Hold | Maintain squad spacing | Coordinated attacks | Group cohesion |
| Rush | Direct path to objective | Overwhelm defenses | Low player resistance |
