# UI Grid System (24 pixels)

## Overview
The 24-pixel grid system provides a standardized framework for UI layout and positioning across all game interfaces. This system ensures consistent alignment, responsive design, and pixel-perfect rendering at different screen resolutions. It supports the game's 20×20 tile aesthetic while maintaining scalability.

## Mechanics
- 24-pixel base unit for all measurements
- Grid-based positioning and sizing
- Responsive scaling for different resolutions
- Alignment helpers and snapping tools
- Consistent spacing and padding rules
- Integration with Love2D graphics system

## Examples
| UI Element | Grid Units | Pixel Size | Use Case |
