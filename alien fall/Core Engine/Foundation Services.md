# Foundation Services

## Overview
Foundation services provide the core infrastructure that supports all game systems, including event handling, service location, and deterministic randomization. These services ensure reliable communication between game components and maintain consistent behavior across different game states and sessions.

## Mechanics
- Event system for inter-component communication
- Service locator pattern for dependency management
- Seeded random number generation for reproducibility
- Initialization sequencing and dependency resolution
- Error handling and logging infrastructure
- Performance monitoring and optimization hooks

## Examples
| Service Type | Purpose | Key Features | Usage |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Event Manager | Component communication | Publish/subscribe pattern | UI updates, game state changes |
| Service Locator | Dependency injection | Interface-based lookup | Accessing game systems |
| Random Service | Deterministic RNG | Seed management | Procedural generation, AI decisions |
