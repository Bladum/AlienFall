# Landing Zone

## Overview
Landing zones are designated areas on the battlescape where player units can initially deploy at the start of a mission. They provide strategic positioning advantages and allow pre-mission tactical planning. The number and size of landing zones scale with map dimensions, enabling players to distribute their team effectively before exploration begins.

## Mechanics
- Map size determines landing zone count: 4x4 maps have 1 zone, 5x5 have 2, 6x6 have 3, 7x7 have 4
- Players assign units to specific zones during mission planning phase
- Units start the mission at their assigned zone locations
- Remaining map areas must be explored during gameplay
- Landing zones are visible on the pre-mission minimap

## Examples
| Map Size | Landing Zones | Strategic Use |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 4x4 | 1 | Central deployment for small, focused missions |
| 5x5 | 2 | Split team for flanking maneuvers |
| 6x6 | 3 | Multi-point insertion for large battles |
| 7x7 | 4 | Coordinated assault from multiple angles |
