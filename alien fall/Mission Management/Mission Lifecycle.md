# Mission Lifecycle

## Overview
The mission lifecycle encompasses the complete process from initial generation through execution, debriefing, and campaign integration. It manages all phases of a mission including preparation, tactical combat, post-mission recovery, and long-term consequences. This system ensures smooth progression between geoscape strategy and battlescape tactics while tracking rewards and penalties.

## Mechanics
- Mission generation based on geoscape events and player actions
- Pre-mission planning and briefing phase
- Tactical execution in battlescape
- Post-mission debriefing with rewards and penalties
- Campaign integration including experience, resources, and story progression
- Sanity checks and wound assessment for surviving units
- Score calculation affecting karma, fame, and reputation

## Examples
| Phase | Duration | Key Activities | Outcomes |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Generation | Instant | Random event triggers | Mission parameters set |
| Planning | 2-5 minutes | Team selection, landing zones | Tactical setup complete |
| Execution | 15-45 minutes | Combat, objectives | Victory/defeat determined |
| Debriefing | Instant | Rewards, casualties | Campaign updates applied |
