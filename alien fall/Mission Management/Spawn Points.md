# Spawn Points

## Overview
Spawn points are randomly distributed locations on the battlescape where enemy units and reinforcements can appear during missions. They form a connected network that enables pathfinding and coordinated enemy movements. This system creates dynamic enemy deployment patterns that adapt to map layout and mission objectives.

## Mechanics
- Random distribution across the map terrain
- Connected network structure for pathfinding between points
- Integration with battle grid system for precise positioning
- Map blocks determine spawn point density and clustering
- Dynamic activation based on mission events and player actions
- Supports reinforcement waves and patrol patterns

## Examples
| Map Type | Spawn Points | Network Structure | Strategic Impact |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Urban | 8-12 | Dense clusters | Close-quarters ambushes |
| Rural | 4-8 | Scattered network | Long-range engagements |
| Mixed | 6-10 | Hybrid connections | Flexible tactics |
