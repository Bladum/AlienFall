# Mission Concealment

## Overview
Mission concealment allows players to conduct stealth operations where certain actions and equipment usage can compromise the mission if detected. It provides a risk-reward mechanic for covert operations, where players can bring advanced gear but must use it carefully to avoid alerting enemies. Missions without concealment budgets allow unrestricted equipment usage without detection penalties.

## Mechanics
- Concealment budget limits detectable actions during battle
- Mission failure occurs if budget is depleted through detection
- Equipment and actions are categorized as stealthy or detectable
- Enemy or neutral unit detection consumes concealment points
- Default missions have unlimited concealment (no restrictions)
- Does not limit equipment brought to battle, only usage during combat

## Examples
| Action Type | Detectable? | Concealment Cost | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Movement | Sometimes | 1-5 points | Depends on terrain and proximity |
| Shooting | Yes | 10-50 points | Higher for loud weapons |
| Grenade use | Yes | 25 points | Area effect increases detection |
| Melee attack | No | 0 points | Silent and stealthy |
| Item activation | Varies | 5-20 points | Depends on item type |
