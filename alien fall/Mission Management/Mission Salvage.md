# Mission Salvage

## Overview
Mission salvage handles post-mission recovery, converting battlefield elements into resources and managing unit debriefing. All destructible terrain, equipment, and personnel are processed for value, while surviving units receive experience and undergo health assessments. This system ensures no resource is wasted and provides consequences for mission outcomes.

## Mechanics
- Battlefield tiles converted to resource credits based on material value
- Surviving enemy units become prisoner items for interrogation/research
- Allied units have energy pools refilled and equipment recovered
- Experience points and medals awarded based on performance
- Sanity loss and wound checks applied to all survivors
- Mission score calculated affecting karma, fame, and reputation
- All unit equipment extracted as recoverable items

## Examples
| Salvage Type | Source | Value/Credits | Special Effects |
|--------------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Terrain Debris | Destroyed cover | 50-200 | Depends on material |
| Enemy Weapons | Dropped equipment | 100-500 | Research potential |
| Prisoner | Live alien | 1000+ | Interrogation value |
| Experience | Combat performance | N/A | Unit advancement |
| Sanity Check | Mission trauma | N/A | Potential status effects |
