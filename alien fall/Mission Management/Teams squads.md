# Teams Squads

## Overview
Team squads organize enemy units into coordinated groups that deploy and operate together on the battlefield. Each squad is designed with complementary roles and abilities, creating tactical synergies. Squads can range from single elite units to large coordinated formations, providing varied combat challenges.

## Mechanics
- Units grouped after inventory assignment phase
- Squads deploy together in single map sectors
- Complementary roles within each squad (damage, support, scouting)
- Size ranges from 1 unit (elite specialists) to full team
- Tactical coordination during combat operations
- Deployment based on mission objectives and terrain

## Examples
| Squad Type | Size | Composition | Tactical Role |
|------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| Assault Squad | 4 units | 2 Assault, 1 Heavy, 1 Medic | Direct engagement |
| Recon Squad | 2 units | 1 Scout, 1 Sniper | Intelligence gathering |
| Elite Squad | 1 unit | High-level specialist | Precision strikes |
| Mixed Squad | 6 units | Balanced classes | All-purpose combat |
