# Mission Planning

## Overview
Mission planning provides critical intelligence and strategic options before deploying to the battlescape. Players receive detailed briefings about terrain, team composition, objectives, and deployment zones. This phase allows tactical preparation without revealing enemy positions or full map details, balancing information with strategic decision-making.

## Mechanics
- Displays terrain type and map size information
- Shows player's team composition and allied units
- Reveals mission objectives (elimination, extraction, defense, etc.)
- Presents landing zone options for unit deployment
- Provides basic environmental conditions and modifiers
- No enemy unit information or full map exploration available

## Examples
| Mission Type | Objectives | Available Intel | Planning Focus |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Assault | Eliminate all enemies | Terrain type, enemy count estimate | Landing zone positioning |
| Extraction | Rescue VIP, extract safely | VIP location hint, time limit | Evacuation routes |
| Defense | Hold position for X turns | Reinforcement schedule | Chokepoint defense |
| Recon | Gather intelligence | Scan areas, avoid detection | Stealth positioning |
