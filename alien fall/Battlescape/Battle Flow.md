# Battle Flow

## Overview
Battle flow manages the turn-based sequence and phases of tactical combat, alternating between player and AI actions. This system ensures fair pacing, maintains tension, and provides structure for complex multi-unit engagements across different initiative systems.

## Mechanics
- Turn sequence management (player vs AI)
- Phase progression (movement, action, resolution)
- Initiative determination and ordering
- Simultaneous action resolution where applicable
- Turn timer and pacing controls
- Interrupt and reaction mechanics

## Examples
| Phase | Player Actions | AI Actions | Duration |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Player Turn | Move, attack, use items | Wait | Variable |
| AI Turn | Execute planned actions | Move, attack, react | Variable |
| Resolution | Apply effects, check conditions | Apply effects | Instant |
| Interruption | Reaction fire, overwatch | Emergency responses | Instant |
