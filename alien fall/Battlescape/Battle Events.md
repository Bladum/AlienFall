# Battle Events

## Overview
Battle events introduce dynamic unpredictability through random or scripted occurrences during combat. These events can include enemy reinforcements, environmental disasters, or sudden opportunities that force tactical adaptation and strategic decision-making.

## Mechanics
- Random event triggers based on turn count or conditions
- Scripted events tied to mission objectives
- Reinforcement spawning and deployment
- Environmental hazard activation
- Temporary effect application
- Player choice integration for some events

## Examples
| Event Type | Trigger | Effect | Duration |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Enemy Reinforcements | Turn 5+ | New units arrive | Permanent |
| Toxic Spill | Random (10%) | Damage over time | 3 turns |
| Supply Drop | Mission objective | Bonus resources | Instant |
| Morale Boost | Low unit morale | Status effect | 2 turns |
