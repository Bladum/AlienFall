# Battle End

## Overview
Battle end conditions determine mission success or failure through victory conditions and scoring systems. These outcomes directly impact campaign progression, resource rewards, and long-term consequences for both player and AI factions.

## Mechanics
- Victory condition evaluation (elimination, extraction, defense, etc.)
- Score calculation based on performance metrics
- Resource and experience rewards distribution
- Campaign progression updates
- Casualty and salvage assessment
- Reputation and diplomatic effects

## Examples
| Victory Type | Conditions | Score Multiplier | Rewards |
|--------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Total Victory | All enemies eliminated | 2.0x | Full salvage, bonus XP |
| Tactical Victory | Objectives completed | 1.5x | Partial salvage, standard XP |
| Pyrrhic Victory | Objectives met, heavy losses | 1.0x | Minimal salvage, reduced XP |
| Defeat | Failure to meet objectives | 0.5x | No rewards, penalties |
