# Battle Size

## Overview
Battle size determines the scale and complexity of tactical engagements through unit count and map dimensions. This scaling system affects difficulty, duration, and strategic depth, ranging from small skirmishes to massive battles that challenge resource management and tactical planning.

## Mechanics
- Unit count scaling (4-32+ units per side)
- Map size adjustment (35x35 to 105x105 tiles)
- Difficulty progression based on scale
- Resource and time requirements
- Tactical complexity increase
- Performance optimization considerations

## Examples
| Battle Scale | Unit Count | Map Size | Duration | Difficulty |
|--------------|------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Skirmish | 4-8 units | 35x35 | 15-30 min | Easy |
| Standard | 8-16 units | 70x70 | 30-60 min | Medium |
| Major | 16-24 units | 105x105 | 60-120 min | Hard |
| Epic | 24-32+ units | 105x105+ | 120+ min | Expert |
