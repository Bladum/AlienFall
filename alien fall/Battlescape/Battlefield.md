# Battlefield

## Overview
The battlefield represents the physical combat environment where tactical engagements occur. Composed of terrain features, structures, and environmental elements, it creates the spatial context that influences movement, cover, and strategic opportunities throughout the battle.

## Mechanics
- Terrain type distribution and effects
- Structure placement and interactions
- Environmental hazard management
- Cover and concealment calculations
- Movement cost modifications
- Strategic positioning opportunities

## Examples
| Terrain Type | Tactical Effects | Movement Impact | Cover Provided |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Urban | Close-quarters | Variable (buildings) | High (structures) |
| Rural | Open spaces | Low (clear) | Low (sparse) |
| Industrial | Complex navigation | High (obstacles) | Medium (machinery) |
| Natural | Environmental hazards | Variable (elevation) | Variable (vegetation) |
