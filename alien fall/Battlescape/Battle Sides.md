# Battle Sides

## Overview
Battle sides define the factions and teams participating in tactical combat, supporting multiple competing entities. This system enables complex scenarios with allies, enemies, neutrals, and potential multiplayer or cooperative gameplay elements within single battles.

## Mechanics
- Multiple faction support (player, AI, allies, neutrals)
- Team composition and relationships
- Alliance and hostility definitions
- Shared victory conditions
- Communication and coordination systems
- Betrayal and diplomacy mechanics

## Examples
| Scenario Type | Sides Involved | Relationships | Complexity |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Standard Combat | Player vs Aliens | Hostile | Low |
| Three-way Battle | Player, Aliens, Mutons | Player-Allies vs Aliens | Medium |
| Cooperative | Player + Allied faction | Friendly cooperation | Medium |
| Multiplayer | Player 1 vs Player 2 | Competitive | High |
