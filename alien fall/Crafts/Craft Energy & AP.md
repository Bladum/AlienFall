# Craft Energy & AP

## Overview
Crafts use an Action Point system similar to units, with energy pools limiting maneuvers and weapon usage during interception. Energy acts as ammo/fuel, regenerating partially each turn.

## Mechanics
- **AP Budget**: Limits actions.
- **Energy Pool**: For ammo/fuel.
- **Regeneration**: Per turn.
- **Integration**: Interception Turn System.

## Examples

Energy Costs:
- Maneuver: 2 energy.
- Fire weapon: 3 energy.

Scenario: Low energy, craft evades instead of attacks.
