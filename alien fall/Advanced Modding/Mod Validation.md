# Mod Validation

## Overview
Mod validation checks the integrity and safety of mod files and scripts before loading. This process verifies file authenticity, script syntax, and potential security risks to ensure only safe, compatible mods are loaded. Validation prevents crashes, exploits, and corrupted game states.

## Mechanics
- File integrity verification (checksums, signatures)
- Script syntax validation and compilation testing
- API usage compliance checking
- Security sandbox testing for malicious code
- Version compatibility verification
- Dependency validation against installed mods

## Examples
| Validation Check | Purpose | Failure Result | Recovery |
|------------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Syntax Check | Code validity | Load failure | Script correction |
| API Compliance | Proper usage | Feature disable | API update |
| Security Scan | Exploit prevention | Mod blocking | Code review |
| Version Check | Compatibility | Warning message | Mod update |
