# Shaders

## Overview
The shader system provides graphics effects for visual enhancements and atmospheric rendering. Supporting lighting, fog, and special effects while maintaining pixel art aesthetics, it creates immersive environments without compromising performance.

## Mechanics
- Lighting calculations and dynamic shadows
- Fog and atmospheric effects
- Special effect rendering (glows, particles)
- Pixel art-friendly post-processing
- Performance optimization for real-time effects
- Cross-platform shader compatibility

## Examples
| Shader Effect | Purpose | Performance Impact | Visual Style |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Dynamic Lighting | Combat illumination | Medium | Realistic shadows |
| Fog of War | Visibility effects | Low | Smooth transitions |
| Damage Glow | Hit feedback | Low | Color-coded effects |
| Water Effects | Environmental rendering | Medium | Animated surfaces |
