# Smoke & Fire

## Overview
Smoke and fire effects create environmental hazards and tactical opportunities, with smoke obscuring vision and fire causing damage over time. These elements can be deployed by units or occur naturally, adding dynamic battlefield conditions. Players must navigate these hazards while using them strategically.

## Mechanics
- **Smoke**: Reduces visibility and accuracy in affected areas.
- **Fire**: Damages units over time, spreads to adjacent tiles.
- **Deployment**: Grenades or abilities create smoke/fire zones.
- **Duration**: Temporary effects that dissipate or burn out.

## Examples

Effect Areas:
- Smoke Cloud: -50% accuracy, lasts 3 turns.
- Fire Patch: 2 damage/turn, spreads 20% chance.

Scenario: Smoke grenade covers retreat; fire traps enemies.
