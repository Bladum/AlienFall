# Objects on Battle Field

## Overview
Objects on the battlefield encompass interactive terrain features, destructible elements, and environmental hazards that influence unit positioning and tactics. These include cover-providing structures, obstacles for movement, and hazards like traps or debris. Managing these objects adds depth to battlescape strategy.

## Mechanics
- **Cover Objects**: Walls, crates provide defense bonuses.
- **Obstacles**: Barricades block movement and sight.
- **Destructible Elements**: Can be destroyed for paths or to remove cover.
- **Hazards**: Environmental dangers like pits or mines.

## Examples

Object Types:
- Low Wall: +20% cover, blocks sight partially.
- Crate: Destructible, provides temporary cover.
- Mine: Hazard, damages on contact.

Scenario: Destroying a wall opens line of fire but exposes units.
