# Suppression

## Overview
Suppression mechanics simulate the psychological and physical effects of intense fire, reducing enemy accuracy and movement capabilities. Units under suppression are pinned, limiting their actions and creating opportunities for flanking. This system adds tension and requires careful fire management.

## Mechanics
- **Suppression Effect**: Reduces accuracy and may prevent movement.
- **Build-Up**: Accumulates from sustained fire.
- **Recovery**: Diminishes over turns or with actions.
- **Counterplay**: Overwatch or cover mitigates suppression.

## Examples

Suppression Levels:
- Light: -10% accuracy.
- Heavy: -30% accuracy, no movement.

Scenario: Suppressive fire pins enemy squad, allowing maneuver.
