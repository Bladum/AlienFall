# Accuracy at Range

## Overview
Accuracy at Range mechanics modify weapon effectiveness based on distance to the target, simulating real-world ballistic challenges and tactical positioning. Closer ranges offer higher accuracy, while long-range shots suffer penalties, encouraging players to balance risk and reward in engagements. This system integrates with cover and terrain to create dynamic combat scenarios.

## Mechanics
- **Range Bands**: Accuracy decreases in tiers (e.g., point-blank, short, medium, long range).
- **Modifiers**: Base accuracy reduced by distance; affected by weapon type, unit skills, and environmental factors.
- **Critical Distances**: Weapons have optimal ranges; exceeding reduces hit chance significantly.
- **Integration**: Combines with Line of Sight and Cover systems for comprehensive targeting.

## Examples

Accuracy Table (for standard rifle):

| Range | Accuracy Modifier | Effective Range |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0-5 tiles | +20% | High |
| 6-10 tiles | 0% | Optimal |
| 11-15 tiles | -20% | Reduced |
| 16+ tiles | -50% | Poor |

Scenario: A sniper at 12 tiles has reduced accuracy, but cover bonuses might compensate.
