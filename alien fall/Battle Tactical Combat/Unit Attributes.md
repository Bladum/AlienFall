# Unit Attributes

## Overview
Unit Attributes encompass core stats like health, strength, and agility that define a unit's baseline capabilities and role in combat. These attributes influence effectiveness in various actions and can be improved through experience or equipment. The system supports diverse unit archetypes and progression.

## Mechanics
- **Core Stats**: Health (HP), Strength (damage), Agility (accuracy/speed).
- **Derived Values**: Calculated from attributes, e.g., MP from agility.
- **Progression**: Increases via leveling or training.
- **Balance**: Attributes cap to prevent overpowered units.

## Examples
