# Time Units

## Overview
Time Units (TU) represent the turn-based action economy, where each action consumes TU to balance fast and deliberate maneuvers. This system ensures units can't perform unlimited actions, encouraging strategic prioritization. It integrates closely with the Action Point System for unified resource management.

## Mechanics
- **TU Budget**: Limited per turn, spent on actions.
- **Action Costs**: Move costs less TU than complex actions.
- **Balance**: Fast actions (e.g., quick shot) vs. slow (aimed shot).
- **Reset**: TU replenish each turn.

## Examples

TU Costs:
- Move: 2 TU
- Quick Shot: 3 TU
- Aimed Shot: 5 TU

Scenario: Unit moves and quick shoots, conserving TU for cover.
