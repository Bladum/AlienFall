# Line of Sight

## Overview
Line of Sight mechanics govern unit visibility and detection, allowing or preventing spotting of enemies based on position and terrain. This system enables fog of war, ambushes, and concealment tactics, requiring players to manage positioning carefully. It works alongside cover and light systems for comprehensive battlefield awareness.

## Mechanics
- **Visibility Checks**: Determines if units can see each other based on facing and obstructions.
- **Concealment**: Terrain or objects can block or reduce sight.
- **Detection Range**: Limited by unit sight stats and environmental factors.
- **Ambush Potential**: Hidden units become visible upon line of sight contact.

## Examples
