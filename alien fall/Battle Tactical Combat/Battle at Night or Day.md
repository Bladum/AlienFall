# Battle at Night or Day

## Overview
Combat during different times of day introduces environmental challenges and opportunities, affecting visibility, unit performance, and tactical choices. Daytime battles favor direct engagements with clear sight, while nighttime operations emphasize stealth and specialized equipment. This system adds temporal strategy to mission planning and execution.

## Mechanics
- **Visibility Effects**: Day provides full sight; night reduces visibility ranges and enables night-specific abilities.
- **Morale Impacts**: Nighttime may lower morale due to fear of the unknown.
- **Equipment Bonuses**: Night vision gear or flares counter darkness penalties.
- **Timing Choices**: Players can schedule missions for optimal conditions.

## Examples

Time Effects Table:

| Time | Sight Modifier | Morale Effect | Special Abilities |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Day | +0% | Neutral | None |
| Night | -50% sight | -10% morale | Night ops bonuses |

Scenario: Night assault with night vision units gains surprise, but low morale risks panic.
