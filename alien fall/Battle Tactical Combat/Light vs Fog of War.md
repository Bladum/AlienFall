# Light vs Fog of War

## Overview
The Light vs Fog of War system manages battlefield information through illumination and concealment, revealing or hiding areas based on light sources and exploration. Light sources dispel fog of war, while darkness maintains it, creating dynamic visibility that evolves with unit actions. This system supports strategic information control and ambush tactics.

## Mechanics
- **Light Sources**: Flares, explosions, or equipment illuminate areas, revealing hidden units.
- **Fog Persistence**: Unlit areas remain obscured until explored or lit.
- **Exploration**: Units moving into fog reveal tiles, but light provides broader vision.
- **Tactical Use**: Players can use light to expose enemies or darkness for stealth.

## Examples

Visibility States:
- Lit Area: Full visibility, no fog.
- Explored Dark: Known terrain, hidden units.
- Unexplored: Complete fog.
