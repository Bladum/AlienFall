# Unit Fatigue

## Overview
Unit Fatigue represents physical exhaustion that accumulates during battles, reducing performance as stamina depletes. It integrates with the Energy Pool System, penalizing prolonged engagements and encouraging rest or rotation. Managing fatigue adds realism and strategic depth.

## Mechanics
- **Accumulation**: Increases with actions, especially running.
- **Effects**: Reduces accuracy, speed, morale.
- **Recovery**: Regenerates during rest or end of battle.
- **Prevention**: Equipment or abilities mitigate fatigue.

## Examples

Fatigue Levels:
- Fresh: 0% penalty
- Tired: -10% accuracy
- Exhausted: -30% stats, risk of collapse

Scenario: Overworked unit fatigues, forcing retreat.
