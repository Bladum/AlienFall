# Enemy Strategy

## Overview
Enemy strategy governs alien invasion planning and high-level decision-making on the geoscape. This AI system creates adaptive invasion patterns, resource allocation, and tactical responses that evolve based on player actions and campaign progress.

## Mechanics
- Invasion pattern generation and timing
- Resource allocation across provinces
- Response to player interception success
- Technology research prioritization
- Base expansion and fortification
- Diplomatic manipulation attempts

## Examples
| Strategy Phase | Key Behaviors | Adaptation Triggers | Difficulty Impact |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Early Invasion | Scouting missions, probe landings | Initial player contact | Low |
| Escalation | Base construction, heavy assaults | Player base destruction | Medium |
| Total War | Multiple fronts, terror missions | High player score | High |
| Desperation | High-risk operations, superweapons | Critical alien losses | Extreme |
