# Base Defense Scenario

## Overview
Base defense scenarios focus on protecting friendly installations from enemy assaults. Players must deploy defensive assets, manage fortifications, and coordinate countermeasures across air, land, and underwater domains. Success requires strategic positioning and effective use of defensive technologies.

## Mechanics
- Defensive positioning and fortification placement
- Multi-domain threat response (air/land/water)
- Countermeasure deployment and activation
- Reinforcement management and timing
- Damage assessment and repair priorities
- Early warning and interception systems

## Examples
| Defense Type | Assets Deployed | Threat Types | Success Metrics |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Air Defense | AA turrets, fighters | Bombers, fighters | Interceptions made |
| Ground Defense | Fortifications, tanks | Assault craft, infantry | Breach prevention |
| Naval Defense | Submarines, patrol boats | Underwater craft | Incursion denial |
