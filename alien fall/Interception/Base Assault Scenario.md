# Base Assault Scenario

## Overview
Base assault scenarios involve offensive operations against enemy-controlled bases and installations. These large-scale engagements combine air, land, and potentially underwater elements with complex objectives. Players must coordinate multiple craft types and tactics to overcome fortified positions.

## Mechanics
- Multi-phase assault planning and execution
- Combined arms coordination (air/land/underwater)
- Fortification damage and breaching mechanics
- Objective-based mission structure
- Reinforcement and defense response systems
- Terrain exploitation for tactical advantage

## Examples
| Assault Type | Craft Composition | Key Objectives | Challenges |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Air Superiority | Fighters + Bombers | Destroy defenses | Anti-aircraft fire |
| Ground Invasion | Transports + Tanks | Capture facilities | Fortified positions |
| Amphibious | Naval + Air support | Beachhead establishment | Coastal defenses |
