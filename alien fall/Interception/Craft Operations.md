# Craft Operations

## Overview
Craft operations involve deploying vehicles to provinces within operational range for interception missions. Crafts consume fuel for transit but return automatically after engagements. Speed ratings determine how many missions a craft can handle in a single turn, enabling strategic allocation of limited assets.

## Mechanics
- Province deployment within craft range
- World tile pathfinding for optimal routes
- Fuel consumption for transit (no mid-mission refueling needed)
- Automatic return after interception completion
- Speed stat determines missions per turn
- Range limitations based on fuel capacity and craft type

## Examples
| Craft Type | Range | Speed | Missions/Turn | Fuel Cost |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Interceptor | 500 km | 3 | 3 | 10 units |
| Bomber | 800 km | 2 | 2 | 25 units |
| Transport | 300 km | 1 | 1 | 15 units |
