# Craft Fuel & Range

## Overview
Craft fuel and range systems determine operational endurance and movement capabilities. Crafts consume specific fuel items stored at bases, with consumption rates affecting how many actions a craft can perform per turn. Speed ratings determine action frequency, creating tactical trade-offs between mobility and sustainability.

## Mechanics
- Fuel items required and consumed from base storage
- Consumption rate per action (e.g., 4 units per action)
- Speed rating determines actions per turn
- Range limitations based on fuel capacity
- Refueling requirements between missions
- Fuel efficiency affecting operational costs

## Examples
| Craft Type | Fuel Type | Consumption/Action | Speed Rating | Range Impact |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fighter | Aviation Fuel | 2 | High (3 actions) | 500 km |
| Bomber | Heavy Fuel | 5 | Medium (2 actions) | 800 km |
| Transport | Standard Fuel | 3 | Low (1 action) | 300 km |
