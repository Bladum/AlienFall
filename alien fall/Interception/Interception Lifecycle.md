# Interception Lifecycle

## Overview
The interception lifecycle manages the complete process from mission detection through engagement and resolution. It coordinates craft deployment, combat execution, and determines follow-up actions based on outcomes. The system seamlessly transitions between geoscape strategy and tactical interception gameplay.

## Mechanics
- Mission detection on geoscape radar
- Craft deployment to target provinces
- Interception screen activation and combat
- Victory outcomes: return to geoscape or transition to battlescape
- Follow-up mission generation (rescue, crash site, etc.)
- Resource and experience allocation

## Examples
| Phase | Actions | Duration | Outcomes |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| Detection | Radar sweep, mission identification | Instant | Mission alert |
| Deployment | Craft selection, fuel consumption | 1 turn | Interception ready |
| Combat | Weapon usage, positioning | Variable | Win/loss determined |
| Resolution | Salvage, experience | Instant | Geoscape/battlescape transition |
