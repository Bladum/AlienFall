# Crash Site Scenario

## Overview
Crash site scenarios occur when enemy UFOs are damaged but not completely destroyed during interception. The wreckage becomes accessible for salvage operations on the ground, providing opportunities for technology recovery and resource collection. These sites create follow-up missions with strategic value.

## Mechanics
- Triggered by partial UFO destruction in interception
- Ground-based salvage operations required
- Technology and resource recovery opportunities
- Time-sensitive missions (alien recovery teams may arrive)
- Risk of alien counter-attacks or reinforcements
- Salvage value based on UFO type and damage level

## Examples
| UFO Type | Salvage Value | Key Items | Risks |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Scout | 5000 credits | Basic tech, fuel | Low alien presence |
| Fighter | 15000 credits | Weapons, alloys | Medium security |
| Terror Ship | 30000 credits | Advanced tech | High threat level |
