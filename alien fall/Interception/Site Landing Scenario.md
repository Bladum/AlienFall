# Site Landing Scenario

## Overview
Site landing scenarios require precise craft positioning and timing for successful deployment or extraction operations. These missions demand accurate navigation and coordination to land at specific locations without detection or interference. Success depends on pilot skill, craft capabilities, and environmental conditions.

## Mechanics
- Precision landing requirements and accuracy
- Timing-based mission parameters
- Environmental condition effects
- Detection risk during approach
- Extraction window management
- Craft capability limitations

## Examples
| Landing Type | Precision Required | Time Window | Challenges |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Hot LZ | High | 30 seconds | Enemy fire |
| Stealth Insert | Extreme | 2 minutes | Detection risk |
| Emergency Extract | Medium | 1 minute | Damaged craft |
