# Mission Detection on Geoscape

## Overview
Mission detection relies on radar coverage from crafts and bases to identify enemy activities in provinces. Undetected missions create ambush risks, while multiple crafts can be deployed to a single province for comprehensive coverage. This system creates strategic depth in interception planning and resource allocation.

## Mechanics
- Radar coverage from crafts and base facilities
- Province scanning for mission identification
- Ambush penalties for undetected missions
- Multiple craft deployment per province
- Detection range based on radar strength
- Real-time mission generation and discovery

## Examples
| Detection Method | Range | Reliability | Consequences |
|------------------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Base Radar | 500 km | High | Standard interception |
| Craft Radar | 200 km | Medium | Mobile detection |
| No Detection | N/A | N/A | Ambush penalties |
