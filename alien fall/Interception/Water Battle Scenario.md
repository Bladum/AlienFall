# Water Battle Scenario

## Overview
Water Battle Scenarios involve naval combat between surface vessels, submarines, and amphibious craft in coastal or oceanic environments. These engagements occur during interception when missions involve water-based UFOs, sites, or craft, requiring specialized tactics for underwater and surface combat.

## Mechanics
- **Surface Combat**: Ships and boats engage in direct fire exchanges
- **Submarine Warfare**: Underwater positioning and sonar detection
- **Amphibious Operations**: Beach landings and coastal assaults
- **Depth Management**: Different layers for surface, shallow, and deep water
- **Environmental Effects**: Currents, waves, and weather impacting movement
- **Detection Systems**: Radar, sonar, and visual spotting mechanics

## Examples
| Combat Type | Units Involved | Key Tactics |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Surface Battle | Naval craft, patrol boats | Gunnery duels, maneuvering |
| Submarine Hunt | Submarines, anti-sub ships | Sonar detection, depth charges |
| Amphibious Assault | Landing craft, coastal defenses | Beach positioning, cover usage |
| Mixed Engagement | Surface and sub-surface | Layer coordination, surprise attacks |
