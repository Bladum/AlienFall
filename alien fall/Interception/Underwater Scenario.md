# Underwater Scenario

## Overview
Underwater scenarios involve submarine combat, exploration, and engagement in aquatic environments. These missions utilize depth, sonar detection, and specialized underwater weapons systems. Players must manage pressure, visibility, and three-dimensional positioning in naval warfare.

## Mechanics
- Depth-based positioning and pressure effects
- Sonar detection and stealth mechanics
- Underwater weapon systems and ranges
- Submarine maneuverability and speed
- Environmental hazards (currents, terrain)
- Surface-to-underwater transitions

## Examples
| Scenario Type | Depth Range | Key Systems | Objectives |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Submarine Hunt | 100-500m | Sonar, torpedoes | Enemy sub destruction |
| Base Assault | 200-800m | Mines, depth charges | Underwater facility capture |
| Recon | 50-300m | Passive sonar | Intelligence gathering |
