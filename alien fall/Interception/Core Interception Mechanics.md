# Core Interception Mechanics

## Overview
Core interception mechanics govern real-time engagements between player and enemy forces across multiple domains. The interception screen divides forces into left (player) and right (enemy) sides, with three vertical layers representing air, land/water, and underground/underwater environments. Combat continues until one side achieves victory or retreats.

## Mechanics
- Screen divided into player (left) and enemy (right) sides
- Three environmental layers: air, land/water, underground/underwater
- Maximum 3 units per section (crafts, UFOs, sites, bases)
- Fixed positioning during engagement (no movement between sections)
- Simultaneous interactions until decisive outcome
- Victory conditions: enemy destruction or forced retreat

## Examples
| Layer | Player Units | Enemy Units | Interaction Type |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Air | 3 Fighter crafts | 2 UFOs, 1 Bomber | Aerial dogfight |
| Land/Water | 2 Tanks, 1 Transport | 3 Assault UFOs | Ground assault |
| Underground/Underwater | 2 Submarines | 1 Underwater base | Submarine warfare |
