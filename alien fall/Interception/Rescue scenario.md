# Rescue Scenario

## Overview
Rescue scenarios are generated when craft pilots are downed during interception combat. These missions focus on recovering surviving crew members from hostile territory, often under time pressure. Success provides experience and maintains personnel continuity, while failure results in permanent losses.

## Mechanics
- Triggered by craft destruction in interception
- Time-sensitive mission parameters
- Pilot survival and extraction objectives
- Hostile territory navigation challenges
- Experience rewards for successful rescues
- Permanent unit loss on failure

## Examples
| Pilot Rank | Rescue Difficulty | Time Limit | Rewards |
|------------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| Rookie | Easy | 48 hours | Basic experience |
| Veteran | Medium | 24 hours | Skill advancement |
| Elite | Hard | 12 hours | Special abilities |
