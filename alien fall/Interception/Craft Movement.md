# Craft Movement

## Overview
Craft movement positioning depends on craft type and operational environment. Different craft types are assigned to specific interception layers based on their capabilities, with province biome influencing land versus water positioning. This system ensures realistic and balanced engagements across air, land, and underwater domains.

## Mechanics
- Air crafts/UFOs positioned in air layer
- Land crafts/bases/sites in land layer
- Underwater crafts/bases/UFOs in underwater layer
- Naval crafts/UFOs in land/water layer (biome-dependent)
- Underground bases in underground layer
- Biome-specific positioning (land vs water provinces)

## Examples
| Craft Type | Primary Layer | Secondary Positioning | Biome Influence |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Fighter Jet | Air | N/A | None |
| Tank | Land | N/A | Land provinces only |
| Submarine | Underwater | N/A | Coastal/water provinces |
| Patrol Boat | Land/Water | Water in coastal biomes | Province type |
| Underground Base | Underground | N/A | Any land province |
