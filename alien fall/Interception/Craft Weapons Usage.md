# Craft Weapons Usage

## Overview
Craft weapons function identically to unit weapons, utilizing energy pools, action points, and cooldown systems. UFOs, crafts, and bases all follow the same combat mechanics as ground units, ensuring consistent gameplay across interception and battlescape engagements.

## Mechanics
- Energy pool consumption for weapon activation
- Action point costs for weapon usage
- Cooldown periods between shots
- Accuracy modifiers and damage calculations
- Ammunition limitations where applicable
- Targeting and firing mechanics

## Examples
| Weapon Type | Energy Cost | AP Cost | Cooldown | Damage Type |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Laser Cannon | 20 | 2 | 1 turn | Energy |
| Missile Launcher | 15 | 3 | 2 turns | Explosive |
| Plasma Gun | 25 | 1 | 3 turns | Plasma |
