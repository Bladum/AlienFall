# Air Battle Scenario

## Overview
Air battle scenarios involve aerial dogfighting and engagement between player crafts and enemy UFOs. These encounters focus on flight physics, weapon ranges, and three-dimensional maneuvering in the atmosphere. Success depends on positioning, timing, and effective use of craft capabilities.

## Mechanics
- Three-dimensional movement and positioning
- Flight physics affecting speed and maneuverability
- Weapon range limitations and targeting systems
- Altitude advantages and disadvantages
- Fuel consumption during aerial maneuvers
- Evasion and pursuit mechanics

## Examples
| Scenario Type | Key Elements | Challenges | Objectives |
|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Dogfight | Close-range combat | Fuel management | Destroy enemy craft |
| Interception | Long-range engagement | Speed matching | Prevent UFO escape |
| Escort | Formation flying | Coordination | Protect friendly units |
