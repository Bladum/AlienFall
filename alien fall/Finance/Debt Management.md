# Debt Management

## Overview
Debt management handles loans, credit lines, and repayment obligations with escalating consequences for default. Players can access emergency funding but must manage interest rates and payment schedules carefully. Unpaid debts lead to sanctions, reduced operations, and potential game-ending financial collapse.

## Mechanics
- Interest accrual on outstanding loan balances
- Scheduled repayment requirements each month
- Escalating penalties for missed payments (sanctions, reduced funding)
- Emergency loan options during financial crises
- Bailout mechanics for critical situations
- Debt-to-income ratio affects credit availability

## Examples
| Debt Level | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment | Consequences |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Low (<10k credits) | 5% | 500 credits | None |
| Medium (10k-50k) | 10% | 1000-5000 credits | Reduced research |
| High (50k-100k) | 15% | 7500-15000 credits | Base closures |
| Critical (>100k) | 20% | 20000+ credits | Game over |
