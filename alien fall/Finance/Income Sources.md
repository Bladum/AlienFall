# Income Sources

## Overview
Income sources provide multiple revenue streams from various operational activities and diplomatic relations. Players can pursue legitimate funding through missions and research, or engage in riskier activities like raids and pillaging. This diversified economic model allows different playstyles while maintaining financial sustainability.

## Mechanics
- Mission completion rewards based on difficulty and success
- Research breakthroughs provide one-time or ongoing income
- Country funding contributions from diplomatic relations
- Base operations generate steady maintenance income
- Manufacturing profits from produced goods and equipment
- Alternative income from raids, salvage, and captured resources

## Examples
