# Country Funding

## Overview
Country funding provides the primary income stream through international contributions based on diplomatic relations and operational performance. Each country maintains a funding level that determines monthly payments, with performance modifiers creating dynamic economic challenges. Poor performance can lead to reduced funding, panic events, or even hostile actions against the organization.

## Mechanics
- Monthly recalculation of contributions based on mission performance
- Funding levels range from 0 (hostile) to 10 (fully supportive)
- Country economy calculated as sum of all province economies
- Score-based relation changes: excellent performance increases relations, poor decreases
- High relations boost funding multipliers, low relations reduce or eliminate payments
- Hostile countries may generate counter-missions against the player

## Examples
| Relation Level | Funding Multiplier | Monthly Effect | Risk |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|------|
| Excellent (9-10) | 1.5x | Bonus payments | None |
| Good (7-8) | 1.0x | Standard funding | Low |
| Neutral (4-6) | 0.5x | Reduced payments | Medium |
| Poor (2-3) | 0.25x | Minimal funding | High |
| Hostile (0-1) | 0x | No funding + missions | Critical |
