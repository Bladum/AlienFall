# Win Lose Game Conditions

## Overview
AlienFall features an open-ended gameplay experience with no traditional win/loss states, emphasizing sandbox-style progression. Players can continue indefinitely through various challenges, but certain conditions can make continuation difficult or impossible. Victory is achieved through comprehensive engagement with all game factions and maintaining global stability.

## Mechanics
- No fixed victory conditions - play continues indefinitely
- Loss conditions: losing all bases, insurmountable debt, complete loss of funding
- Victory through total faction elimination and world liberation
- Progressive difficulty scaling with player advancement
- Multiple playstyles supported (diplomatic, military, economic)
- Endgame challenges become increasingly complex

## Examples
| Condition Type | Trigger | Effect | Recovery Possible? |
|----------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Base Loss | All bases destroyed | Game over | No |
| Financial Ruin | Unpayable debt | Operations halt | With bailout |
| Diplomatic Collapse | All countries hostile | No funding | Difficult |
| Victory | All factions defeated | Endgame content | N/A |
