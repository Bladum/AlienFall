# Report for Score and Budget per Region

These reports help players understand the consequences of their actions and optimize base placement and operations. Score metrics influence diplomatic relations and funding levels across different regions.

## Mechanics

- Score modifiers affecting country relations
- Budget allocation recommendations
- Threat level assessments for future planning
- Historical trend analysis for strategic decisions
