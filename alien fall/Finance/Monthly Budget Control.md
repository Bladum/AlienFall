This system enables long-term planning and prevents financial surprises that could cripple operations.

## Mechanics
- Monthly income calculation from all sources
- Expense tracking for bases, salaries, research, and maintenance
- Debt service requirements and interest payments
- Budget variance analysis showing over/under spending
- Forecasting tools for upcoming months
- Emergency budget adjustments during crises
