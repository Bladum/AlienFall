# Base Capacities from Facilities

## Overview
Base Capacities from Facilities define the operational limits and capabilities provided by installed facilities, including storage, production, and defense enhancements. These capacities scale with facility levels and types, enabling base expansion and specialization. Managing capacities is crucial for efficient base operations.

## Mechanics
- **Storage and Housing**: Limits for items, units, crafts, prisoners.
- **Production**: Slots for research and manufacturing.
- **Recovery and Training**: Beds for healing, training facilities.
- **Defense and Detection**: Radar range, defense power.

## Examples

Capacity Scaling:
- Level 1 Lab: 1 research project
- Level 2 Hangar: 4 crafts

Scenario: Overcapacity forces selling excess items.
