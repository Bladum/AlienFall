# Base Cover

## Overview
Base Cover facilities reduce the visibility of the base to enemy missions and UFOs, providing stealth and protection from detection. Higher cover levels make the base harder to locate, integrating with the Mission Cover System. Strategic placement and upgrades enhance base security.

## Mechanics
- **Cover Stat**: Reduces detection probability.
- **Facilities**: Specific buildings provide cover bonuses.
- **Upgrades**: Higher levels increase effectiveness.
- **Integration**: Works with radar and defenses.

## Examples

Cover Facilities:
- Camouflage Net: +20% cover
- Underground Bunkers: +50% cover

Scenario: High cover base evades UFO scans.
