# Mission - Site

## Overview
Site missions involve the discovery and assault of temporary alien installations established at specific locations. These generic enemy outposts remain stationary until engaged by players, providing heavily defended tactical challenges that reward thorough preparation and execution.

## Mechanics
- Stationary location-based objectives
- Temporary existence until player engagement
- Heavy defensive emplacements
- No growth or mission generation scripts
- Province-based positioning
- Detection requirements for engagement

## Examples
| Site Type | Duration | Defense Level | Tactical Focus |
|-----------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Outpost | 1-2 weeks | Light | Reconnaissance |
| Fortress | 3-4 weeks | Heavy | Assault operations |
| Research Lab | 2-3 weeks | Medium | Intelligence gathering |
| Supply Depot | 1 week | Light | Resource denial |
