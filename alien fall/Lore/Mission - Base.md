# Mission - Base

## Overview
Base missions involve the discovery and assault of permanent alien installations established in provinces. These stationary threats grow over time, generate additional missions, and require dedicated interception and battlescape operations to neutralize completely.

## Mechanics
- Stationary province-based installations
- Automated base script growth systems
- Interception defense capabilities
- Large-scale multi-level battlescape engagements
- Daily negative score penalties
- Global threat level impacts

## Examples
| Base Type | Location | Defense Features | Assault Challenges |
|-----------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Surface Military | Land province | AA batteries, patrols | Direct assault |
| Underground Research | Any land | Hidden entrances, traps | Discovery and breach |
| Underwater Command | Coastal | Submarine defenses | Naval operations |
| Orbital Relay | Space-adjacent | Advanced sensors | Complex interception |
