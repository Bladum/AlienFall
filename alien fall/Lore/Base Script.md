# Base Script

## Overview
Base scripts manage the static behavior and growth patterns of alien bases throughout the campaign. These automated systems control base development progression, defensive capabilities, and mission generation patterns that create ongoing strategic challenges for players.

## Mechanics
- Monthly behavior execution cycle
- Base growth limitation (maximum 4 levels)
- Mission generation scheduling
- Defensive capability scaling
- Resource allocation management
- Threat level assessment

## Examples
| Base Level | Growth Requirements | Monthly Missions | Defensive Strength |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | Initial construction | 1-2 scout missions | Basic patrols |
| Level 2 | Technology threshold | 3-4 assault missions | Light defenses |
| Level 3 | Resource accumulation | 5-6 terror missions | Medium fortifications |
| Level 4 | Maximum development | 7+ major operations | Heavy defenses |
