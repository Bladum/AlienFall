# Calendar

## Overview
The calendar system governs all time-driven mechanics on the geoscape, creating a dynamic campaign progression through daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly cycles. This temporal framework ensures consistent pacing and escalating challenges as the invasion intensifies.

## Mechanics
- Daily cycle: Research, manufacturing, UFO activity, repairs
- Weekly cycle: Unit healing, mission creation, base scripts
- Monthly cycle: Campaign triggers, reports, stock replenishment
- Quarterly cycle: Campaign frequency increases
- Yearly cycle: Major escalation events
- Weighted faction selection for campaigns

## Examples
| Time Scale | Key Events | Frequency | Impact |
|------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Daily | Research progress, UFO movement | 24 hours | Incremental advancement |
| Weekly | Mission generation, healing | 7 days | Tactical opportunities |
| Monthly | Campaign starts, reports | 30 days | Strategic shifts |
| Quarterly | Difficulty scaling | 90 days | Long-term escalation |
| Yearly | Major events | 365 days | Campaign milestones |
