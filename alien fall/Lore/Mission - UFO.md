# Mission - UFO

## Overview
UFO missions feature mobile alien craft that move between provinces according to scripted patterns. These dynamic threats require interception operations and can lead to follow-up missions when destroyed or when they damage player assets, creating complex engagement chains.

## Mechanics
- Mobile craft movement between provinces
- Scripted behavioral patterns
- Interception-based engagement
- Multi-domain combat (air, land, water)
- Crash site generation on destruction
- Recovery mission creation for downed pilots

## Examples
| UFO Type | Movement Pattern | Combat Domain | Follow-up Missions |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Scout | Random patrol | Air | Crash site |
| Fighter | Aggressive pursuit | Air/Land | Recovery mission |
| Transport | Supply routes | Air | Cargo recovery |
| Submarine | Underwater transit | Water | Salvage operations |
