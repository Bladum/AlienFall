# UFO Script

## Overview
UFO scripts control the behavioral patterns and movement of alien craft during missions on the geoscape. These automated sequences dictate daily actions, positioning, and responses, creating predictable yet challenging interception opportunities for players.

## Mechanics
- Daily behavioral execution
- Multi-day script duration
- Single action per day limitation
- Movement, attack, and scoring actions
- Interception pause functionality
- Province-based navigation

## Examples
| Script Type | Daily Actions | Duration | Player Response |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Patrol | Move between provinces | 5 days | Interception |
| Assault | Attack bases, score points | 3 days | Defense missions |
| Transport | Supply delivery routes | 7 days | Cargo interception |
| Recon | Intelligence gathering | 4 days | Stealth avoidance |
