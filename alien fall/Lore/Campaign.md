# Campaign

## Overview
Campaigns serve as the primary narrative framework and mission generators for each alien faction. These long-term strategic operations create sustained threats through phased mission deployment, regional focus, and escalating challenges that define the invasion's progression.

## Mechanics
- Faction-specific campaign generation
- Monthly triggering on the 1st day
- Phased mission deployment (Week 1: 1 mission, Week 3: 2 missions)
- Regional weighting and focus areas
- Mission sequencing with delays
- Completion rewards and penalties
- Progressive difficulty scaling

## Examples
| Campaign Type | Duration | Mission Pattern | Regional Focus |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Infiltration | 2 months | Scout → Assault → Terror | Urban centers |
| Conquest | 3 months | Base → Supply → Control | Resource-rich areas |
| Terror | 1 month | Multiple terror missions | Population centers |
| Research | 4 months | Raid → Capture → Escape | Tech facilities |
