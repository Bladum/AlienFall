## Overview

Advanced interactive widgets provide sophisticated interaction patterns for complex interface requirements. These widgets manage hierarchical data, multi-pane interfaces, and contextual operations with advanced state management and user experience optimizations.

## TreeView Widget

### Purpose
Hierarchical data display and navigation widget for exploring nested information structures with expand/collapse functionality.

### Key Features

#### Hierarchical Structure
- Multi-level node organization with parent-child relationships
- Visual tree structure with connecting lines and indentation
- Support for unlimited nesting depth with performance optimization

#### Node Types
- **Container Nodes**: Branch nodes that can be expanded/collapsed
- **Leaf Nodes**: End nodes containing data or actions
- **Mixed Nodes**: Nodes that can contain both sub-nodes and data

#### Visual States
- Expanded/collapsed state indicators with smooth animations
- Selection highlighting with multi-selection support
- Hover effects and keyboard focus indicators
- Custom node icons and styling based on node type

#### Interaction Model
- Click to select, double-click to expand/collapse
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys and Enter/Space
- Drag-and-drop support for node reorganization
- Context menu integration for node-specific actions

### Game-Specific Usage
- Research tree navigation and technology dependencies
- Facility construction requirements and upgrade paths
- Unit organization and command structure
- Mission objective hierarchies and sub-objectives

### Implementation Details
```lua
-- Example usage
local treeView = TreeView:new(x, y, width, height, {
    rootNode = researchTree,
    nodeTemplate = function(node)
        return {
            text = node.name,
            icon = node.icon,
            expanded = node.defaultExpanded,
            selectable = node.selectable
        }
    end,
    onNodeSelected = function(node) showResearchDetails(node) end,
    onNodeExpanded = function(node) loadChildNodes(node) end
})
```

## TabControl Widget

### Purpose
Multi-pane interface management widget that organizes related content into tabbed sections for efficient screen space utilization.

### Key Features

#### Tab Management
- Dynamic tab creation, removal, and reordering
- Tab scrolling for interfaces with many tabs
- Close buttons and tab-specific controls
- Tab grouping and organization options

#### Content Areas
- Dedicated content area for each tab with independent scrolling
- Lazy loading of tab content for performance optimization
- Content persistence across tab switches
- Independent state management per tab

#### Visual Design
- Consistent tab styling with active/inactive states
- Smooth transitions between tab content
- Customizable tab appearance and positioning
- Support for tab icons and status indicators

#### Navigation
- Mouse click and keyboard shortcuts for tab switching
- Tab cycling with Ctrl+Tab navigation
- Tab history and back/forward navigation
- Accessibility support with proper tab ordering

### Game-Specific Usage
- Base management sections (Facilities, Research, Manufacturing)
- Strategic planning interfaces (Geoscape, Bases, Research)
- Equipment management categories (Weapons, Armor, Utilities)
- Mission planning phases (Objectives, Resources, Personnel)

## MenuBar Widget

### Purpose
Application-level navigation and command organization widget providing hierarchical menu access to application functions.

### Key Features

#### Menu Structure
- Hierarchical menu organization with submenus
- Dynamic menu content based on application state
- Menu item grouping and separator support
- Keyboard shortcuts and accelerator keys

#### Visual Behavior
- Pull-down menu display with smooth animations
- Menu highlighting and selection feedback
- Submenu cascading with proper positioning
- Auto-hide behavior for inactive menus

#### Menu Items
- Text labels with optional icons and shortcuts
- Checkable menu items for toggle states
- Disabled state support with visual dimming
- Custom menu item types and styling

#### Integration
- Global keyboard shortcut handling
- Context-aware menu content
- Recent items and favorites support
- Menu customization and user preferences

### Game-Specific Usage
- Main application menu (File, Edit, View, Help)
- Game-specific menus (Missions, Research, Bases)
- Tool menus for different game modes
- Context-sensitive menus based on current screen

## ContextMenu Widget

### Purpose
Context-sensitive popup menu that appears at cursor position to provide relevant actions for the current context.

### Key Features

#### Contextual Display
- Mouse position-based placement with boundary checking
- Context-aware menu content based on target element
- Dynamic menu generation based on current state
- Smart positioning to avoid screen edges

#### Menu Content
- Action-specific menu items with icons and descriptions
- Hierarchical submenus for complex action sets
- Separator lines for logical grouping
- Disabled items for unavailable actions

#### Visual Design
- Consistent styling with application theme
- Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations
- Shadow and border effects for depth
- High contrast for accessibility

#### Interaction Model
- Right-click activation (configurable)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Auto-dismiss on outside clicks
- Action feedback and confirmation

### Game-Specific Usage
- Unit action menus in battlescape
- Facility management options in base view
- Research project context actions
- Map interaction menus in geoscape

## Implementation Notes

### State Management
Advanced interactive widgets require sophisticated state management:
- Hierarchical state persistence across sessions
- Undo/redo support for complex operations
- State synchronization across related widgets
- Performance optimization for large data sets

### Performance Optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large hierarchical data
- Lazy loading of menu content and submenus
- Efficient rendering with minimal draw calls
- Memory management for dynamic content

### Accessibility Features
- Full keyboard navigation for all interaction modes
- Screen reader support with proper labeling
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Configurable input methods and shortcuts

### Integration Patterns
- Event-driven communication between widgets
- Shared state management for related components
- Consistent theming and styling across widgets
- Extensible architecture for custom widget types

### Testing Requirements
- Complex interaction testing with multiple input methods
- Performance testing with large data sets
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
