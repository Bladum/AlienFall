## Overview

The marketplace system establishes Alien Fall's primary commerce framework, providing a deterministic, low-risk acquisition method for equipment, recruits, and resources through predictable purchase and delivery mechanics. The system integrates with transfer logistics to create visible supply chains and strategic base placement decisions, with data-driven listings, stock management, and prerequisite systems controlling progression and regional availability.

Marketplace transactions create transfer orders with delivery delays, contrasting with instant alternatives while maintaining deterministic reputation impacts and comprehensive modding support. The marketplace functions as a stable economic anchor that contrasts with riskier alternatives like the black market.

## Mechanics

### Access and Scope Framework

Basescape-integrated commerce system with comprehensive item availability:

- Basescape Integration: Marketplace accessible through base management interface
- Listing Categories: Equipment, resources, units, and complete craft systems
- Delivery Integration: Purchase transactions spawn transfer orders with variable delivery times
- Scope Management: Global marketplace with regional and supplier-specific variations
- UI Accessibility: Clear interface showing prerequisites, stock, delivery time, and consequences

### Purchase Flow and Transfer Integration

Deterministic transaction processing with logistics visibility:

- Transaction Processing: Immediate purchase commitment with deferred delivery execution
- Transfer Order Creation: Void-to-base transfers with 1-5 day delivery windows based on item type
- Arrival Mechanics: Purchased items created in base inventory upon transfer completion
- Capacity Management: Delivery phase handles base storage and hangar limitations with overflow policies
- Logistics Visibility: Transfer system provides tracking and strategic planning tools
- No Pre-Validation: Purchases don't check destination capacity at buy time, handled on arrival

### Selling System Architecture

Direct inventory conversion with economic and reputation consequences:

- Inventory Access: Players sell any stored tradable items from base storage
- No Stock Constraints: Selling operates without restocking or availability limitations
- Transaction Simplicity: Direct inventory-to-credits conversion without transfer delays
- Price Determinism: Fixed sell prices (typically 50% of purchase price) with no market fluctuations
- Economic Balance: Selling provides resource recovery without marketplace complexity
- Reputation Integration: Sales transactions may impact fame and karma metrics

### Pricing and Economic Systems

Transparent pricing structure with consistent markup mechanics:

- Base Price Structure: Items defined with core sell_price values in configuration data
- Purchase Markup: Fixed 200% multiplier creating consistent pricing expectations
- Policy Integration: Organization policies may enhance market prices and access
- Supplier Independence: Pricing unaffected by supplier relationships or negotiations
- Economic Transparency: Clear price display with markup explanations shown to players
- Balance Controls: Pricing system supports strategic purchasing decisions and budget planning

### Prerequisites and Access Control

Research and regional gating controlling marketplace availability:

- Supplier Requirements: Research unlocks specific supplier access and item listings
- Technology Gates: Research prerequisites control item availability progression
- Regional Restrictions: Geographic requirements limit certain purchases to specific regions/provinces
- Facility Dependencies: Base infrastructure requirements for advanced item categories
- Service Prerequisites: Operational capabilities required for specialized equipment
- Reputation Thresholds: Karma and fame minimums for restricted or sensitive items

### Stock and Restocking

Strategic scarcity mechanics for high-value and limited items:

- Stock Limits: Certain listings have limited monthly availability (e.g., 2 units per month)
- Restocking Cycle: Stock refilled on monthly tick according to listing configuration
- Purchase Decrement: Available stock reduced with each purchase transaction
- Strategic Scarcity: Limited stock creates meaningful planning and prioritization decisions
- Availability Tracking: UI shows remaining stock and restock timing

### Reputation and Consequence Systems

Deterministic reputation impacts from marketplace transactions:

- Transaction Impacts: Purchases and sales modify player fame and karma scores
- Deterministic Effects: Reputation changes calculated and displayed before confirmation
- Strategic Trade-offs: Players balance immediate benefits against long-term consequences
- Supplier Relationships: Reputation affects future access and pricing negotiations
- Diplomatic Implications: Reputation changes influence faction interactions and diplomatic options
- Recovery Mechanics: Reputation modification systems with potential restoration through positive actions
