## Overview

Alien Fall's Save System provides comprehensive game state persistence, enabling players to preserve and resume campaigns at any point during gameplay. The system ensures data integrity through robust serialization, compression, versioning, and corruption recovery while maintaining performance and backward compatibility.

The save system captures all aspects of game progress including world state, unit development, mission status, economic conditions, and mod content. It supports automatic and manual saving with comprehensive error recovery and version migration capabilities.

## Mechanics

### Save State Categories

The save system preserves multiple categories of game state to enable complete campaign restoration.

Campaign State:
- World geography and province status
- Base infrastructure and facility construction
- Research advancement and technology completion
- Resource inventories and funding levels
- Game calendar and temporal progression

Unit and Personnel:
- Soldier statistics, experience, and skill progression
- Equipment assignment and inventory allocation
- Craft configuration and crew assignments
- Health status and injury recovery tracking
- Career advancement and specialization paths

Mission and Combat:
- Active mission status and objective progress
- Tactical battlescape state and positioning
- UFO tracking and movement pattern intelligence
- Historical mission records and performance metrics
- Achievement tracking and score accumulation

Economic Systems:
- Financial management and expenditure tracking
- Market dynamics and item pricing fluctuations
- Manufacturing queues and production schedules
- Trading relationships and supplier status
- Budget analysis and financial reporting

Mod Integration:
- Custom content state and configuration preservation
- Applied modifications and override tracking
- Mod compatibility and version management
- Extension data and custom content information
- Integration validation and data integrity checking

### Persistence Mechanics

The persistence system uses efficient data handling to maintain performance while ensuring complete state preservation.

Serialization Framework:
- TOML-based human-readable configuration format
- Data compression for storage optimization
- Type preservation across save/load cycles
- Complex object relationship management
- Separate handling of large binary assets

Memory Optimization:
- Reference deduplication to eliminate redundancy
- Lazy loading for on-demand data retrieval
- Streaming processing for large file handling
- Memory budgeting and resource monitoring
- Intelligent caching of frequently accessed data

File Organization:
- Logical directory structure and naming conventions
- Metadata management and file indexing
- Automatic backup creation and maintenance
- Related file grouping and dependency tracking
- Efficient disk usage and storage optimization

### Version Compatibility

The system maintains compatibility across game versions through semantic versioning and automated migration.

Semantic Versioning:
- Major version changes requiring migration
- Minor version updates with backward compatibility
- Patch version fixes without functional changes
- Compatibility matrix defining version interactions
- Planned migration pathways for upgrades

Migration Automation:
- Seamless automatic save file upgrading
- Data transformation for new version requirements
- Default value assignment for missing fields
- Validation verification of successful migration
- Rollback capabilities for failed updates

Backward Compatibility:
- Legacy save file loading support
- Existing functionality preservation
- Progressive enhancement for new features
- Deprecation management for outdated elements
- User assistance during version transitions

### Data Integrity Protection

Multiple layers of validation prevent data corruption and enable recovery from errors.

Checksum Validation:
- Complete file integrity verification
- Individual data segment validation
- Rolling verification for partial corruption detection
- Cryptographic hash generation for assurance
- Status reporting for integrity verification

Corruption Detection:
- Automatic identification during loading process
- Backup restoration options for recovery
- Partial reconstruction of valid data segments
- Minimal playable state generation when needed
- Clear user notification of corruption status

Backup Systems:
- Automatic pre-save backup generation
- Rolling retention of multiple backup versions
- Manual backup creation options
- Backup integrity validation
- Intelligent selection of best recovery option

### Auto-Save Automation

Automatic saving ensures progress preservation without user intervention.

Trigger Conditions:
- Time-based activation at regular intervals
- Event-based saving for major occurrences
- Transition saving during mode changes
- Milestone preservation at achievement points
- Critical moment protection during high-stakes situations

Configuration Management:
- User preference customization for auto-save behavior
- Adjustable frequency and interval settings
- Retention policy for maximum save count
- Trigger customization for specific events
- Performance balancing to minimize system impact

Management Automation:
- Automatic file rotation and cleanup
- Storage monitoring and disk space tracking
- Background operation transparency
- Error handling for failed auto-saves
- Performance impact minimization

### Save File Management

Comprehensive user interface and operations for save file handling.

User Interface:
- Save browser for comprehensive file exploration
- Detailed metadata display and information
- Visual previews and screenshot thumbnails
- Campaign summaries and progress overviews
- Compatibility indicators and warning systems

File Operations:
- New save file creation with metadata
- Existing file restoration with validation
- Safe file deletion with backup protection
- External file export and sharing capabilities
- External file import and compatibility checking

Organization Systems:
- File categorization by type and content
- Consistent naming conventions and identification
- Search and filtering capabilities for discovery
- Multiple sorting and display options
- Bulk operations for multiple file management

### Performance Optimization

The save system maintains high performance through multiple optimization strategies.

Loading Performance:
- Incremental processing saving only changed data
- Non-blocking background save operations
- Progress feedback during long operations
- Memory-efficient serialization techniques
- Caching strategies for frequently used data

Storage Optimization:
- Advanced compression algorithms for size reduction
- Data deduplication to eliminate redundancy
- Optimized storage structure utilization
- File size limitations and management
- Bandwidth-efficient network transfers

Resource Management:
- CPU utilization optimization during operations
- Memory usage control and monitoring
- Efficient disk I/O operations
- Network bandwidth management for online features
- Battery consumption consideration for mobile platforms

### Error Recovery Systems

Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for various failure scenarios.

Error Classification:
- Disk space and storage capacity issues
- File permission and access restriction problems
- Data corruption and integrity compromises
- Version compatibility and conflict issues
- Platform-specific system failure scenarios

Recovery Mechanisms:
- Automatic repair and self-healing corrections
- Interactive user-guided problem resolution
- Alternative loading using backup files
- Graceful degradation with reduced functionality
- Maximum data preservation during failures

User Communication:
- Clear error description and impact notification
- Available recovery option presentation
- Progress updates during recovery operations
- Success confirmation and verification
- Prevention guidance for future error avoidance
