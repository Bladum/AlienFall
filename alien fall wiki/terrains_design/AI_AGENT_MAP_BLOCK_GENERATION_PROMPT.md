## Critical Technical Constraints

### ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - VIOLATION WILL CAUSE SYSTEM FAILURE

1. **SINGLE LEVEL ONLY**
   - All structures exist on ONE 2D plane
   - NO multi-floor buildings
   - NO vertical stacking
   - Buildings represented by ground-level footprint only

2. **ONE TILE, ONE ELEMENT**
   - Each tile position contains EXACTLY ONE character
   - NO layering (no floor + wall + roof)
   - If tile is wall '#', it's ONLY a wall (not wall on floor)
   - If tile is floor '.', it's ONLY a floor
   - Objects (tables, crates) REPLACE the floor tile at that position

3. **BLOCK SIZE REQUIREMENTS**
   - Width and height MUST be multiples of 15 (15, 30, 45, 60...)
   - Standard sizes:
     - **Primary Standard**: 15x15 tiles (~80% of all blocks)
     - **Double Standard**: 30x30 tiles (large structures)
     - **Extended Standard**: 45x30 tiles (long structures)
     - **Triple Standard**: 45x45 tiles (rare, massive structures)
   - Square blocks preferred, rectangular allowed (30x15, 45x30)
   - NEVER use non-standard sizes (20x15, 25x20, 17x13, etc.)

4. **BORDER SPACING REQUIREMENTS**
   - MANDATORY: Leave at least 1 tile walkable space on 2+ sides of structures
   - RECOMMENDED: Leave 1 tile border on all 4 sides
   - Ensures unit movement around structures and flanking opportunities
   - Example: 12x10 building in 15x15 block = 1-2 tile borders on each side

5. **NO CUT STRUCTURES**
   - Structures must NEVER be cut in half between blocks
   - Each block is completely self-contained
   - Buildings, UFOs, vehicles must fit ENTIRELY within one block (with borders)
   - If structure doesn't fit, use larger block size

6. **SCALE CONSISTENCY**
   - 1 tile = 1 meter (approximately)
   - Car: 4-5 tiles long, 2 tiles wide
   - Door: 1 tile wide
   - Room: minimum 3x3 tiles (small) to 8x8 tiles (large)
   - Roads: 2-4 tiles wide (NOT 1 tile)
   - Paths: can be 1 tile wide

## Three-Phase Generation Methodology

You MUST follow this three-phase approach to generate human-quality, tactically interesting map blocks.

### Phase 1: Macro-Structure (The Intent)

**Purpose**: Define the block's main strategic purpose and primary features.

**Required Specifications**:

1. **Block Type & Category**
   - Clearly state: Terrain type (Urban, Forest, Arctic, etc.)
   - Function type (Residential, Commercial, Ambush, Chokepoint, etc.)
   - Tactical purpose (Cover-heavy, Open killzone, Maze-like, etc.)

2. **Major Feature Rule**
   - MUST contain ONE primary structural feature
   - Examples:
     - Road running North-South (2-4 tiles wide)
     - Central building (8x8 to 12x12 structure)
     - Natural path (1-2 tiles wide, curved)
     - Open plaza (6x6 to 10x10 clear area)
   - Feature must be non-linear where appropriate (use curves, angles)

3. **Point of Interest (POI)**
   - MUST contain ONE secondary feature
   - Examples:
     - Small clearing (3x3 grass area)
     - Vehicle (4-5 tile car/truck)
     - Boulder cluster (2-4 large rocks)
     - Equipment cache (storage area)
   - Adds asymmetry and tactical focal points

4. **Density Budget**
   - Define tile distribution percentages:
     - Walkable terrain: 50-70%
     - Obstacles/Cover: 20-40%
     - Impassable terrain: 10-30%
   - Prevents uniform or empty blocks
   - Ensures tactical variety

### Phase 2: Adjacency and Constraint (The Cohesion)

**Purpose**: Ensure blocks can tile seamlessly with neighboring blocks.

**Required Specifications**:

1. **Edge Tagging**
   - Tag each edge (North, South, East, West) with dominant terrain type
   - Tag options:
     - `ROAD_A` = 2-4 tile wide road
     - `ROAD_B` = 2-4 tile wide road (different orientation)
     - `PATH` = 1 tile wide path
     - `FOREST_DENSE` = Heavy tree coverage
     - `FOREST_SPARSE` = Light tree coverage
     - `BUILDING_WALL` = Structure edge
     - `OPEN_GRASS` = Open grassland
     - `OPEN_DESERT` = Open sand/rock
     - `WATER_EDGE` = Water boundary
     - `URBAN_MIXED` = Mixed urban elements
   - If 50%+ of edge is road, tag as road
   - Ensures compatible block connections

2. **Neighbor Consistency**
   - Edge must allow natural connection to blocks with same tag
   - Roads must align at same Y-coordinate (horizontal) or X-coordinate (vertical)
   - Terrain must blend gradually (no sudden forest-to-desert transitions)
   - Buildings must have 2+ tile gap at edges

3. **Forbidden States**
   - NO 4x4 area filled with identical tiles (unless intentional design)
   - NO perfectly symmetrical layouts (adds human irregularity)
   - NO floating structures (all elements must be grounded/connected)
   - NO dead-ends without tactical purpose (every path should lead somewhere)

### Phase 3: Micro-Detail (The Scatter & Asymmetry)

**Purpose**: Add fine details that make blocks feel hand-crafted.

**Required Specifications**:

1. **Fine-Grained Noise Pass**
   - Add scattered detail elements:
     - Small rocks (⌂) scattered in natural terrain
     - Rubble (░) near damaged structures
     - Grass patches (,) in cleared areas
     - Equipment (♪) in operational areas
   - Use high-frequency random patterns (not uniform grids)

2. **Masking/Exclusion**
   - EXCLUDE detail elements from:
     - 2 tiles around major features (roads, buildings)
     - 1 tile from block edges (clean connection points)
     - Inside structures (use appropriate interior objects instead)
   - Keeps important areas clean and readable

3. **Cluster Probability**
   - When placing detail element, increase probability (20-40%) for neighbors
   - Maximum cluster size: 3-5 tiles
   - Creates natural-looking clumps (bush clusters, rubble piles, rock formations)
   - Prevents "scattered dots" appearance

4. **Variant Utilization**
   - Note suggested variants in metadata comments
   - Examples:
     - Tree variants (pine, oak, dead)
     - Bush variants (small, medium, dense)
     - Rock variants (small boulder, large boulder, cluster)
   - Adds visual richness without changing tile functionality

## Generation Algorithm Guidance

### Recommended Algorithms by Block Type

**Natural Terrain (Forest, Desert, Mountain)**:
- **Cellular Automata**: For organic terrain distribution (50-60% of layout)
- **Perlin Noise**: For elevation/density variation (30-40% of features)
- **Scatter Distribution**: For trees, rocks, vegetation (20-30% details)
- **Drunkard's Walk**: For natural paths and clearings

**Urban Terrain (Residential, Commercial, Industrial)**:
- **BSP (Binary Space Partitioning)**: For building layout and room division (70-80% of structure)
- **Prefab Placement**: For vehicles, equipment, furniture (30-40% of details)
- **Wave Function Collapse**: For wall patterns and facade variety
- **Voronoi Diagram**: For property boundaries and lot division

**Special Terrain (UFO Crash, Alien Base, Research Facility)**:
- **Prefab Placement**: For main structure (UFO, central facility)
- **Destructive Generation**: For damage/debris around crash sites
- **Maze Generation**: For alien ship interiors and corridors
- **Cellular Automata**: For organic alien growth patterns

**Mixed Terrain (Urban/Forest transition, Coastal areas)**:
- **Combination Approach**: Layer multiple algorithms
- **Terrain Flow**: Use Perlin noise for gradual transitions
- **Edge Blending**: Carefully craft edges for smooth connections

- Vehicle provides mobile cover in open area
- Corner creates natural ambush point with sight lines down both roads
- Multiple entry points to buildings (doors on different sides)

Connectivity Notes:
- North edge: Connects to road blocks (ROAD_A) - road continues at columns 0-1
- East edge: Connects to road blocks (ROAD_A) - road continues at rows 0-1
- South edge: Building wall, connects well to residential or commercial blocks
- West edge: Mixed urban, can connect to buildings, roads, or open areas

Suggested Visual Variants:
- ':' (Asphalt): Fresh_Asphalt, Cracked_Asphalt, Faded_Asphalt
- ',' (Grass): Short_Grass, Weeds, Overgrown_Grass
- '█' (Vehicle): Military_Truck, Civilian_Van, Police_Car
