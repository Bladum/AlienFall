## Overview

The Fame system measures the player's organizational visibility and public prestige, creating strategic trade-offs between public recognition and operational security. Fame influences funding availability, recruitment quality, and mission difficulty while providing players with meaningful choices about their public profile. The system uses deterministic calculations and comprehensive tracking to ensure reproducible outcomes and clear player feedback.

Key design principles include:
- Visibility Trade-offs: High fame provides benefits but increases risks
- Deterministic Calculations: Seeded modifiers ensure consistent outcomes
- Comprehensive Tracking: Complete audit trail of fame changes
- Strategic Depth: Multiple paths to manage organizational reputation
- Player Agency: Clear visibility into fame consequences and modifiers

## Mechanics

### Fame Scale and Levels
Fame operates on a 0-100 scale with five distinct levels that determine global effects and capabilities.

Fame Levels:
- Obscure (0-20): Minimal public awareness with operational freedom
- Notable (21-40): Growing recognition with moderate visibility effects
- Prominent (41-60): Significant public presence with balanced trade-offs
- Famous (61-80): High visibility with enhanced benefits and risks
- Legendary (81-100): Maximum prestige with extreme consequences

Level Characteristics:
- Each level provides specific multipliers for game systems
- Threshold crossings trigger immediate effect changes
- Visual and narrative representation in UI
- Progressive scaling of benefits and drawbacks

### Fame Sources
Fame changes originate from various game activities with different visibility impacts.

Mission Outcomes:
- High-Visibility Success: Major public displays (+10 base)
- Standard Success: Routine operations (+5 base)
- Low-Visibility Success: Covert operations (+1 base)
- Mission Failure: Public setbacks (-2 base)
- Civilian Casualties: Public relations damage (-3 per casualty)

Publicity Actions:
- Press Release: Deliberate media engagement (+20)
- Public Celebration: Victory announcements (+15)
- Official Denial: Damage control (-10)

Research Completions:
- Stealth Technology: Reduced visibility research (+2)
- Public Relations Tech: Media manipulation research (+8)
- Cloaking Research: Concealment technology (+1)

Base Events:
- Attack Successfully Repelled: Defensive victory (+8)
- Base Destroyed: Major setback (-15)
- New Base Construction: Expansion announcement (+3)
- Public Facility Tour: Media event (+12)

### Fame Effects
Fame levels provide global modifiers that affect multiple game systems simultaneously.

Funding Effects:
- Low Fame: Reduced government support (0.5x multiplier)
- High Fame: Increased official funding (1.5x multiplier)
- Moderate Fame: Standard funding levels (1.0x multiplier)

Recruitment Effects:
- Low Fame: Limited access to quality personnel (0.7x quality)
- High Fame: Premium recruitment opportunities (1.3x quality)
- Moderate Fame: Standard recruitment pool (1.0x quality)

Mission Effects:
- Low Fame: Reduced strategic pressure (0.8x difficulty)
- High Fame: Increased detection and targeting (1.2x difficulty)
- Moderate Fame: Standard mission parameters (1.0x difficulty)

Economic Effects:
- Low Fame: Improved black market terms (1.2x discount)
- High Fame: Reduced black market access (0.9x discount)
- Moderate Fame: Standard market rates (1.0x multiplier)

### Fame Modifiers
Players can influence fame generation through policies, research, and equipment choices.

Policy Modifiers:
- Silent Running: Global reduction in fame accrual (50% reduction)
- Public Relations Focus: Increased fame from positive events (25% bonus)
- Covert Operations: Reduced fame from mission successes (30% reduction)

Research Modifiers:
- Stealth Technology: Mission visibility reduction (30% fame decrease)
- Cloaking Systems: Public display fame reduction (50% decrease)
- Media Training: Publicity action effectiveness increase (50% bonus)

Equipment Modifiers:
- Stealth Armor: Individual mission fame reduction (20% decrease)
- Silent Weapons: Combat visibility reduction (10% decrease)
- Cloaking Fields: Detection avoidance enhancement (60% decrease)

Modifier Application:
- Multiplicative stacking with defined precedence order
- Source-specific targeting (missions, publicity, research)
- Temporary vs. permanent modifier distinctions
- Clear UI presentation of active modifiers

## System Integration

### Funding System Integration
Fame directly influences monthly government funding and financial support levels.

Funding Multipliers:
- Base funding adjusted by fame level multipliers
- Additional discretionary funding for high-fame organizations
- Reduced allocations for low-visibility operations
- Emergency funding availability based on public support

Economic Incentives:
- High fame unlocks additional funding sources
- Low fame provides alternative revenue streams
- Strategic funding decisions based on fame management goals

### Recruitment System Integration
Fame affects personnel availability and quality in recruitment pools.

Recruitment Quality:
- Enhanced applicant pools at high fame levels
- Specialized recruitment access for prestigious organizations
- Reduced competition for low-profile operations
- Quality bonuses applied to all recruitment categories

Availability Effects:
- Increased recruitment speed at high fame
- Expanded candidate pools for famous organizations
- Limited options during periods of obscurity
- Strategic timing of recruitment based on fame cycles

### Mission System Integration
Fame influences mission generation, difficulty, and strategic targeting.

Mission Difficulty:
- Increased challenge scaling with fame levels
- Higher priority targeting by alien forces
- Enhanced mission objectives for prestigious organizations
- Reduced pressure during low-visibility periods

Mission Availability:
- Access to high-profile mission types at elevated fame
- Covert operation opportunities during obscurity
- Strategic mission generation based on public profile
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on fame trends
