## Overview

The Debt Management System establishes comprehensive financial risk frameworks for Alien Fall's economic gameplay, implementing loan mechanics, repayment structures, and recovery options while maintaining deterministic outcomes and strategic consequences. The system creates meaningful financial decision-making through credit rating systems, collateral requirements, and bankruptcy mechanics while providing players structured paths to manage cash shortfalls without immediate game termination. The framework balances economic pressure with recovery opportunities, enabling strategic debt utilization and long-term financial planning.

Debt provides structured financial levers for players to manage cash shortfalls without forcing immediate game over, creating strategic choices between punitive credit with long tails, emergency liquidity, or operational shrinkage.

## Mechanics

### Minimum Payment and Overdraft Systems

Daily financial monitoring prevents uncontrolled borrowing:
- Payment Enforcement: Daily negative balance monitoring with MinimumPayment = max(floor(abs(Balance) Ã— min_payment_pct), fixed_minimum)
- Overdraft Conversion: Automatic loan creation from sustained negative balances with Principal = abs(balance)
- Penalty Structures: Late payment fees, credit rating deterioration, and interest rate increases
- Threshold Management: Minimum payment percentage and fixed minimum requirements
- Balance Monitoring: Continuous financial position assessment and alert systems
- Conversion Triggers: Automatic loan generation criteria and timing mechanisms

### Repayment and Recovery Frameworks

Structured repayment with flexible recovery options:
- Amortization Schedules: Fixed payment structures using Principal, interest_rate_daily, and term_days
- Early Repayment Options: Prepayment penalties and fee structures for early payoff
- Automatic Recovery Actions: Asset liquidation, project suspension, and emergency contract activation
- Deferment Mechanisms: Payment postponement and restructuring options with approval probabilities
- Negotiation Systems: Terms modification and approval probability frameworks
- Strategic Recovery: Long-term financial rehabilitation and stability restoration

### Short-Term Liquidity Instruments

Flexible borrowing options for immediate cash needs:
- Revolving Credit Lines: Flexible borrowing limits with daily interest accumulation and repayment flexibility
- Emergency Advances: High-interest immediate funding with reputation consequences and explicit terms
- Supplier Credit: Trade credit extensions and invoice financing based on relationship levels
- Bridge Financing: Temporary funding solutions for cash flow gaps and construction projects
- Contingency Funding: Crisis response financial instruments and emergency availability
- Liquidity Management: Short-term cash position stabilization and optimization

### Lender and Underwriting Architecture

Diverse lending sources with risk-based approval:
- Lender Categorization: Commercial banks, supplier credit lines, private investors, and black market financiers
- Approval Criteria: Credit rating, reputation, and relationship requirement systems

- Exposure Limits: Maximum borrowing capacity and diversification requirements

### Interest, Fees, and Penalty Structures

Comprehensive cost structures with transparent pricing:
- Interest Calculation: Daily and periodic rate application with compounding options
- Fee Assessment: Origination, servicing, transaction, and penalty cost frameworks
- Penalty Systems: Late payment, default, and covenant violation consequences
- Rate Determination: Risk-based pricing and credit rating influence on terms
- Cost Transparency: Fee disclosure and total borrowing cost calculation
