## Overview

The Income Sources Management System establishes comprehensive revenue generation frameworks for Alien Fall's economic gameplay, implementing diverse income streams, risk-reward balancing, and strategic economic decision-making. The system creates meaningful financial strategy through predictable baseline income, opportunistic opportunities, illicit activities, and financial instruments while maintaining deterministic outcomes and moddability. The framework balances economic depth with accessibility, providing players multiple pathways to financial success and strategic trade-offs between stability and profitability.

Multiple income sources encourage players to balance steady, predictable streams with higher-yield but riskier options. Treating income as first-class simulation entities makes economic strategy explicit and tunable, supporting distinct playstyles and meaningful trade-offs between short-term liquidity and long-term political or reputational costs.

## Mechanics

### Primary Income Frameworks

Primary income establishes the foundation of economic stability through governmental and operational support:
- Country Funding Systems: Baseline governmental support and performance-based allocation
- Recurring Revenue Streams: Predictable income sources and long-term financial planning
- Legal Economic Activities: Compliant business operations and regulatory adherence
- Performance-Linked Income: Achievement-based revenue and success monetization
- Strategic Economic Positioning: Geographic advantage exploitation and market positioning
- Sustainable Income Models: Long-term viability and economic stability frameworks

### Recurring and Legal Revenue Systems

Recurring revenue provides stable cash flow through ongoing operations and agreements:
- Manufacturing Operations: Production facility income and goods monetization through market sales or contracts
- Service Contracts: Ongoing service agreements for sensor arrays, escort fleets, or logistics support
- Research Grants: Conditional funding for hosting or performing designated research projects
- Royalty Management: Intellectual property licensing and passive income from technology blueprints
- Investment Income: Portfolio returns, dividends, and equity participation
- Market Sales: Commercial goods trading and bulk transaction processing

### One-Time and Opportunistic Revenue

Opportunistic revenue captures unique opportunities and special circumstances:
- Contract Missions: Task-based assignments and bounty collection from suppliers or factions
- Salvage Operations: Wreck recovery and material reclamation from mission sites
- Artifact Trading: Rare item auctions and exhibition monetization of alien technology
- Special Operations: Unique mission opportunities and extraordinary income events
- Event-Based Revenue: Campaign-specific economic opportunities and windfalls
- Strategic Acquisitions: Asset purchase and control monetization

### Illicit and High-Risk Activities

High-risk activities offer premium returns with reputation and political consequences:
- Black Market Operations: Underground trading with higher prices but deterministic reputation penalties
- Smuggling Networks: Restricted goods transportation with detection risk and profit generation
- Raiding Economics: Hostile asset seizure and resource appropriation with diplomatic fallout
- Captive Monetization: Prisoner handling and controversial income sources with severe penalties
- False-Flag Operations: Covert activities paid by shadow clients with exposure risks
- Shadow Economy Integration: Underground market participation and risk assessment

### Craft Loss Economic Impact

Craft destruction creates significant financial consequences and strategic decisions:

- Replacement Costs: Full craft rebuilding cost (50-80% of original purchase price)
- Insurance Premiums: Monthly payments for coverage (2-5% of craft value)
- Salvage Recovery: Partial refunds from destroyed craft recovery missions
- Morale Penalties: Base crew morale reduction affecting recruitment and efficiency
- Funding Impact: Country funding reductions due to perceived incompetence
- Strategic Reassessment: Forced tactical adjustments and mission planning changes

### Logistics and Meta-Source Systems

Advanced economic systems create secondary revenue through optimization and licensing:
- Manufacturing Licensing: Third-party production authorization and royalty collection
- Platform Monetization: Marketplace access fees and transaction processing revenue
- Subscription Models: Recurring payment systems for continuous services or intelligence feeds
- Value-Added Processing: Raw material refinement and product enhancement for higher margins
- Distribution Networks: Supply chain optimization and logistics efficiency improvements
- Economic Multipliers: Scale effects and efficiency bonus systems

### Data-Driven Configuration Architecture

The system supports extensive customization through data-driven parameters:
- Template Systems: Income source definition and parameter configuration
- Deterministic Outcomes: Predictable results and reproducible economics for testing
- Modding Integration: Community customization and behavior modification
- Balance Tuning: Economic parameter adjustment and difficulty scaling
- Event Integration: Campaign state influence and dynamic modification
- Performance Monitoring: Economic health tracking and optimization analysis
