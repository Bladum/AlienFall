## Overview

Underwater Battle handles submarine and aquatic engagements between player craft and underwater UFOs. It implements specialized mechanics for underwater combat, including pressure effects, aquatic movement, and specialized weapon systems adapted for underwater environments.

## Mechanics

### Aquatic Environment
- Pressure Systems: Depth-based damage and movement penalties
- Visibility Limits: Reduced sight ranges underwater
- Current Effects: Water movement affecting positioning
- Breathing Mechanics: Oxygen management for submerged operations

### Submarine Craft
- Depth Control: Vertical positioning in water column
- Aquatic Propulsion: Specialized underwater movement systems
- Pressure Resistance: Hull integrity and depth limitations
- Sonar Systems: Detection and targeting underwater

### Underwater Weapons
- Torpedo Systems: Long-range underwater projectiles
- Depth Charges: Area-effect anti-submarine weapons
- Sonic Weapons: Sound-based attack systems
- Mine Deployment: Static underwater defenses

### Combat Dynamics
- Three-Dimensional: Full 3D positioning (x, y, depth)
- Slow Movement: Reduced speed underwater
- Stealth Mechanics: Silent running and detection avoidance
- Environmental Hazards: Underwater terrain and obstacles

### Detection Systems
- Active Sonar: Loud but accurate detection
- Passive Sonar: Silent listening for enemy noise
- Magnetic Anomaly: Metal detection systems
- Thermal Imaging: Heat signature detection

### Damage and Destruction
- Flooding Effects: Water ingress damage over time
- Pressure Damage: Hull breach from depth changes
- Explosive Effects: Underwater blast propagation
- Salvage Operations: Wreck recovery mechanics

## Examples

### Environmental Effects
- Shallow Water: Limited depth, better visibility, surface access
- Deep Ocean: Extreme pressure, poor visibility, thermal vents
- Coastal Waters: Mixed terrain, civilian shipping interference
- Arctic Conditions: Ice cover, temperature effects, limited access

### Submarine Operations
- Silent Running: Reduced noise, lower detection risk
- High Speed: Fast movement, increased noise and detection
- Depth Changes: Vertical maneuvering for tactical advantage
- Surface Breach: Emergency surfacing or weapon launch

### Weapon Systems
- Torpedo Launch: Homing projectiles with speed and range
- Depth Charge: Area denial weapons with blast radius
- Sonic Disruptor: Non-lethal disabling through sound waves
- Mine Field: Static defenses triggered by proximity

### Combat Scenarios
- Submarine Duel: Two submarines maneuvering in 3D space
- Surface Support: Ships and aircraft assisting underwater combat
- Base Defense: Underwater base protecting against submarine assault
- Salvage Mission: Recovering technology from sunken UFOs
