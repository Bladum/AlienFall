## Overview

Enemy Base Assault and Site Landing handles scenarios where player craft directly assault enemy bases or land at sites without air combat interception. These missions involve strategic targeting of enemy installations, covert insertions, and direct transitions to ground-based objectives including base destruction, artifact recovery, and sabotage operations.

## Mechanics

### Assault Scenarios
- Base Targeting: Player craft assault enemy underground/underwater bases
- Landing Operations: Craft land at enemy sites for ground missions
- No Air Combat: Direct transition to ground-based objectives
- Strategic Objectives: Base destruction, artifact recovery, prisoner rescue

### Mission Types
- Base Assault: Direct attack on enemy base facilities
- Site Landing: Covert landing for reconnaissance or sabotage
- Infiltration: Stealth insertion for internal objectives
- Destruction: Base demolition and asset denial

### Transition Logic
- Direct Landing: No interception screen for air combat
- Ground Deployment: Immediate transition to battlescape
- Objective Assignment: Mission-specific goals and conditions
- Resource Carryover: Craft capabilities affect ground operations

### Base Architecture
- Facility Layout: Enemy base structure and defenses
- Security Systems: Internal security and detection mechanics
- Access Points: Landing zones and entry methods
- Destruction Requirements: Critical facility targeting

### Site Characteristics
- Terrain Integration: Site location affects mission parameters
- Defensive Posture: Enemy base readiness and response
- Asset Distribution: Valuable targets and objectives
- Escape Routes: Extraction and retreat mechanics

### Operational Phases
- Approach Phase: Navigation to target location
- Landing Phase: Ground deployment and initial positioning
- Execution Phase: Objective completion and combat
- Extraction Phase: Mission completion and withdrawal

## Examples

### Assault Types
- Direct Assault: Craft lands, units deploy to attack base entrance
- Stealth Insertion: Covert landing, infiltration through maintenance tunnels
- Orbital Bombardment: Pre-landing bombardment weakens defenses
- Combined Arms: Air support coordinates with ground assault

### Mission Objectives
- Base Destruction: Eliminate command center and power systems
- Artifact Recovery: Secure alien technology and research data
- Prisoner Rescue: Extract captured personnel from holding facilities
- Sabotage: Disable enemy operations without full destruction

### Site Variations
- Underground Base: Deep facility with multiple levels
- Underwater Installation: Submerged base with aquatic approaches
- Remote Outpost: Isolated facility with limited defenses
- Urban Site: City-integrated base with civilian complications

### Operational Flow
- Reconnaissance: Initial scans identify optimal landing zones
- Deployment: Units establish perimeter and secure landing area
- Penetration: Breach outer defenses and enter base proper
- Objective Execution: Complete mission goals under time pressure
