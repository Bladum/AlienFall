| Action        | AP Cost | Description                  |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------|
| Move (1 tile) | 1 AP    | Walk to adjacent tile        |

### Moving Your Soldiers

**Step 1: Select First Soldier**
- Click on John "Rookie" Doe (or press `1`)
- His movement range appears as blue highlighted tiles

**Step 2: Plan Your Movement**
- Green tiles = Safe movement (cover available)
- Yellow tiles = Open (no cover)
- Red tiles = Danger zone (alien sight lines)

**Step 3: Move Forward**
- Click on a tile 4-6 spaces ahead toward the UFO
- Soldier walks to position (costs 4-6 AP)
- Check remaining AP in bottom bar

**Step 4: Take Cover**
- Click on wall/rock/debris if available
- Half-shield icon 🛡️ = Half cover (+20 defense)
- Full-shield icon 🛡️🛡️ = Full cover (+40 defense)
- Press `C` to crouch for extra cover bonus

**Repeat for All Soldiers:**
1. Select next soldier (press `2`, `3`, etc.)
2. Move toward UFO
3. Spread out (don't cluster together!)
4. End in cover positions
5. Save 4 AP for shooting if you see enemies

### Ending Your Turn

When all soldiers have moved:
1. Click "End Turn" button (or press `Space`)

---

## Turn 2-3: First Contact

### Encountering Aliens

When enemies appear (fog lifts), you'll see:

```
⚠️ CONTACT: 2 SECTOIDS DETECTED ⚠️

[Enemy appears as red humanoid figure]
Location: Near UFO entrance
Distance: 12 tiles
Threat: Low (Sectoids = weakest alien type)
```

### Combat Basics

**Shooting Mechanics:**

1. **Select Soldier with AP ≥ 4**
2. **Click "Shoot" Action**
3. **Target Enemy** - Click on alien
4. **Check Hit Chance** - Shows % to hit
   ```
   TARGET: Sectoid
   Range: 12 tiles
   Cover: Half Cover
   ─────────────────
   Hit Chance: 65%
   Crit Chance: 5%
   Damage: 3-5
   ─────────────────
   [Confirm] [Cancel]
   ```
5. **Confirm Shot** - Click "Confirm"
6. **Watch Result** - Hit/Miss/Crit animation plays

**Hit Chance Factors:**
- **Soldier Aim Stat** - Base 65 for rookies
- **Range** - Closer = higher chance
- **Enemy Cover** - Half (-20%), Full (-40%)
- **Elevation** - High ground = +20% bonus
- **Flanking** - Side/rear shots = +30% bonus

### Tactical Shooting Strategy

**Priority Targets:**
1. **Closest Enemies First** - Reduce immediate threats
2. **Wounded Aliens** - Finish off damaged enemies
3. **Exposed Targets** - Shoot aliens without cover
4. **Flanked Enemies** - Take advantage of positioning

**Example First Engagement:**

```
Turn 2 Action Sequence:
─────────────────────────────────────────
1. Soldier 1 (John): Move to flank position (6 AP)
   → Shoot Sectoid #1: 75% hit → HIT! (4 damage) (4 AP)
   → Remaining: 2 AP

2. Soldier 2 (Jane): Move closer (4 AP)
   → Shoot Sectoid #1: 70% hit → HIT! (5 damage)
   → Sectoid #1 KILLED!

3. Soldier 3 (Mike): Overwatch mode (4 AP)
   → Watches corridor for alien movement

4. Soldier 4 (Sarah): Move to support position (6 AP)
   → Ready to heal if needed
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Using Overwatch

**When to Use Overwatch:**
- Covering doorways/corridors
- Last soldier action with 4+ AP remaining
- Expecting alien reinforcements
- Defensive positions

**How to Overwatch:**
1. Select soldier with 4+ AP remaining
2. Click "Overwatch" action
3. Blue cone shows firing arc
4. Soldier auto-shoots first enemy that moves in cone
5. Lasts until next turn or until fired

---

## Mid-Mission: Pushing Forward

### Managing the Fog of War

The fog of war hides unexplored areas:

**Fog Mechanics:**
- **Soldier Vision**: 15-20 tile radius per soldier
- **Revealed on Movement**: Fog lifts as you advance
- **Hidden Enemies**: Aliens in fog are invisible
- **Surprise Encounters**: Moving into fog may trigger contacts

**Safe Fog Exploration:**
1. **Move in Pairs** - Never send 1 soldier alone
2. **Overwatch Support** - Have 2+ soldiers on overwatch
3. **Check Corners** - Aliens hide around corners
4. **Slow Advance** - Don't rush into unknown areas

### Handling Multiple Enemies

When facing 3+ enemies:

**Focus Fire Strategy:**
- 2-3 soldiers shoot same target
- Guarantees kills vs spreading damage
- Reduces enemy action economy

**Example Multi-Enemy Turn:**
```
Situation: 3 Sectoids visible
─────────────────────────────────────────
Priority: Sectoid A (closest, flanked)

Soldier 1: Shoot Sectoid A → 4 damage
Soldier 2: Shoot Sectoid A → 5 damage  ✓ KILL
Soldier 3: Shoot Sectoid B → 3 damage
Soldier 4: Overwatch
─────────────────────────────────────────
Result: 1 killed, 1 wounded, 1 untouched
```

### Using Grenades

Grenades are powerful AoE weapons:

**Grenade Mechanics:**
- **Cost**: 4 AP to throw
- **Range**: 8-10 tiles
- **Damage**: 3-6 to all in blast radius
- **Blast Radius**: 3x3 tile area
- **Destroys Cover**: Removes walls/obstacles

**When to Use Grenades:**
1. **Grouped Enemies** - 2+ aliens clustered
2. **Entrenched Enemies** - Aliens in heavy cover
3. **Guaranteed Damage** - No hit chance roll (always hits)
4. **Emergency** - Multiple wounded enemies

**How to Throw Grenade:**
1. Select soldier with grenade
2. Click "Items" → Select grenade
3. Click target tile (shows blast radius)
4. Confirm throw
5. Watch explosion animation

---

## Taking Damage: Using Medkits

### When Soldiers Get Hit

If aliens shoot your soldiers:

```
⚠️ SOLDIER HIT ⚠️
John "Rookie" Doe
HP: 100 → 75 (-25 damage)
Status: Wounded (Minor)
```

**Wound Severity:**
- **Minor** (75-99 HP): No penalties, keep fighting
- **Moderate** (50-74 HP): -10% aim penalty
- **Serious** (25-49 HP): -20% aim, -2 AP penalty
- **Critical** (<25 HP): -30% aim, -4 AP, may panic

### Using Medkits

Medkits restore HP during missions:

**Medkit Stats:**
- **Heals**: 15-25 HP
- **Cost**: 4 AP
- **Charges**: 3 uses per medkit
- **Range**: Adjacent tile only

**How to Heal:**
1. Select soldier with medkit
2. Move adjacent to wounded soldier
3. Click "Items" → Select medkit
4. Click wounded soldier
5. Confirm heal (4 AP spent)

**Healing Priority:**
1. **Critical Wounds** - <25 HP soldiers first
2. **Exposed Soldiers** - Healing those in open/combat
3. **Key Soldiers** - Protect best shooters
4. **Conservation** - Save charges for emergencies

## Mission Objective: Clearing the UFO

### UFO Entry Points

UFOs have 1-2 entrances:

```
        [UFO DIAGRAM]
    ╔═══════════════════╗
    ║   👽 👽          ║
    ║         🛸        ║
    ║            👽    ║
    ╚═════╗     ╔══════╝
          ║     ║
       [DOOR] [DOOR]
          ↓     ↓
    [Your Squad Here]
```

**Entry Strategy:**
1. **Stack Outside** - Position all soldiers near door
2. **Breach Team** - Send 2 soldiers inside first
3. **Support Team** - Keep 2 soldiers outside on overwatch
4. **Clear Rooms** - Methodically clear interior
5. **Flank** - Use both doors to surround enemies

### Interior Combat

Inside UFOs is close-quarters:

**CQC Tips:**
- **Short Range** = Higher hit chance
- **Cover Scarce** - Expect to take hits
- **Move + Shoot** - Rush positions quickly
- **Grenades Shine** - Cramped spaces = multi-kills

**Final Room Clearance:**
```
Turn 8: UFO Command Room
─────────────────────────────────────────
Enemies: 1 Sectoid Leader (last alien)

Soldier 1: Flank left side → Shoot (85%) → HIT! (6 damage)
Soldier 2: Flank right side → Shoot (80%) → HIT! (5 damage)
Sectoid Leader: KILLED!

🎉 MISSION COMPLETE! 🎉
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if a soldier dies?**  
A: Permanent death (permadeath). Hire replacements in Barracks. First missions are forgiving, but deaths increase in difficulty.

**Q: Can I save during missions?**  
A: No mid-mission saves (Ironman mode). Plan carefully!

**Q: What if I run out of ammo?**  
A: Use Reload action (2 AP). Carry enough ammo for ~3 full magazines.

**Q: Should I destroy enemy cover?**  
A: Yes! Grenades destroy cover, exposing aliens for easier shots.

**Q: What's the turn limit?**  
A: Most missions are 20-30 turns. No hard limit, but reinforcements may spawn.

**Q: Can I withdraw from missions?**  
A: Yes, but forfeit all rewards and suffer morale penalty. Only in emergencies.
