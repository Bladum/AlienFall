# Meta Game Systems

## Overview

The meta folder contains documentation for game systems that operate above individual gameplay mechanicsâ€”systems governing difficulty scaling, accessibility features, audio design, player tutorials, and overall game balance. These meta-systems shape the player experience across all aspects of Alien Fall.

## Files in This Section

- [Accessibility.md](Accessibility.md) - Accessibility features and inclusive design
- [Audio.md](Audio.md) - Sound design, music systems, and audio feedback
- [Difficulty.md](Difficulty.md) - Difficulty scaling and challenge progression
- [Tutorial.md](Tutorial.md) - Player onboarding and tutorial systems

## Subdirectories

- [balance/](balance/) - Game balance systems and numerical tuning
- [tutorials/](tutorials/) - Tutorial content and progressive learning systems

## Purpose

Meta-systems documentation addresses cross-cutting concerns that affect gameplay holistically:

- **Accessibility**: Color-blind modes, control remapping, difficulty adjustments
- **Audio**: Sound effects, music integration, ambient audio, feedback systems
- **Difficulty**: Dynamic scaling, player skill accommodation, challenge curves
- **Tutorials**: Progressive learning, contextual help, skill introduction pacing
- **Balance**: Numerical tuning, power curves, progression pacing, fairness metrics
