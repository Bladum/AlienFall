# Battlescape Mission Systems Documentation

## Overview

The `mission` folder contains comprehensive documentation for the mission generation, management, and resolution systems in Alien Fall's battlescape. These systems create dynamic, replayable tactical scenarios that combine strategic objectives with emergent gameplay, ensuring each mission offers unique challenges while maintaining balance and fairness.

The mission architecture implements a complete lifecycle from strategic planning through tactical execution to post-mission resolution, with extensive modding support and deterministic generation for reproducible outcomes.

### Core Components

#### 1. **Mission Objectives** (`Mission objectives.md`)
The goals and victory conditions that define mission success or failure. Objectives range from simple elimination tasks to complex multi-stage operations with dynamic win conditions.

**Objective Types:**
- **Elimination**: Destroy all enemy forces or key targets
- **Survival**: Protect assets for a specified duration
- **Extraction**: Escort units or recover items under time pressure
- **Sabotage**: Destroy or disable specific installations
- **Reconnaissance**: Gather intelligence without direct confrontation
- **Multi-Stage**: Sequential objectives with changing conditions

#### 2. **Mission Deployment** (`Mission Deployment.md`)
The initial setup phase where units are positioned and mission parameters are established. Deployment zones, spawn points, and initial conditions are configured for balanced tactical scenarios.

**Deployment Mechanics:**
- **Zone Assignment**: Designated areas for each faction
- **Unit Placement**: Strategic positioning within deployment zones
- **Initial Conditions**: Environmental states and objective markers
- **Fog of War**: Asymmetric information and visibility rules
- **Time Limits**: Deployment phase duration and preparation time

#### 3. **Mission Preparation** (`Mission preparation.md`)
Pre-mission planning and briefing systems that allow players to review objectives, assess risks, and make strategic decisions before deployment.

**Preparation Systems:**
- **Intelligence Briefing**: Mission details and known threats
- **Loadout Selection**: Equipment and unit customization
- **Tactical Planning**: Deployment strategy and positioning
- **Risk Assessment**: Difficulty evaluation and success probabilities
- **Contingency Planning**: Backup strategies and extraction plans

#### 4. **Mission Concealment** (`Mission Concealment.md`)
Stealth and detection mechanics that govern unit visibility and surprise. Concealment systems create tension through asymmetric information and tactical positioning.

**Concealment Mechanics:**
- **Detection Ranges**: Distance-based visibility calculations
- **Noise Generation**: Audible alerts from movement and actions
- **Light Levels**: Illumination affecting stealth effectiveness
- **Terrain Cover**: Environmental concealment opportunities
- **Alert States**: Progressive enemy awareness levels

#### 5. **Spawn Points** (`Spawn Points.md`)
Dynamic unit deployment locations that activate during mission progression. Spawn systems manage reinforcements, patrols, and environmental threats.

**Spawn Mechanics:**
- **Activation Triggers**: Time-based, event-driven, or conditional spawning
- **Capacity Limits**: Maximum units per spawn point
- **Faction Assignment**: Enemy, ally, or neutral unit deployment
- **Strategic Positioning**: Tactical placement for balanced encounters
- **Reinforcement Waves**: Progressive difficulty through timed spawns

#### 6. **Mission Zones** (`Mission Zones.md`)
Geographic areas within the battlefield that have special rules, objectives, or tactical significance. Zones create spatial objectives and environmental challenges.

**Zone Types:**
- **Objective Zones**: Areas containing mission-critical targets
- **Restricted Zones**: Dangerous or forbidden areas
- **Safe Zones**: Protected areas for extraction or defense
- **Hazard Zones**: Environmentally dangerous regions
- **Control Zones**: Areas that must be held or contested

#### 7. **Squad Autopromotion** (`Squad Autopromotion.md`)
Automatic rank advancement and skill progression for units that demonstrate exceptional performance during missions.

**Promotion Mechanics:**
- **Performance Metrics**: Combat effectiveness and objective contribution
- **Skill Unlocks**: New abilities based on mission achievements
- **Rank Progression**: Hierarchical advancement system
- **Specialization**: Class-specific promotion paths
- **Campaign Impact**: Long-term character development

#### 8. **Mission Salvage** (`Mission salvage.md`)
Post-mission resource recovery and cleanup operations. Salvage systems determine what equipment, intelligence, and resources are recovered after mission completion.

**Salvage Mechanics:**
- **Recovery Chances**: Probability-based item retrieval
- **Condition Assessment**: Equipment damage and repair needs
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Mission data and enemy analysis
- **Resource Allocation**: Salvaged materials for base development
- **Economic Impact**: Mission profitability and resource gains

## Mission Generation System

### Deterministic Generation
All missions use seeded algorithms for reproducible outcomes:

- **Seed-Based Creation**: Identical missions from same parameters
- **Modular Components**: Reusable mission elements and scripts
- **Balance Algorithms**: Difficulty scaling and fairness checks
- **Variety Systems**: Randomization within controlled bounds

### Mission Parameters
Configurable elements that define mission characteristics:

```toml
[mission_config]
seed = 12345
difficulty = "normal"
max_turns = 30
time_limit = 1800  # seconds

[objectives.primary]
type = "elimination"
target = "ufo_commander"
time_limit = 1200

[deployment.zones]
player_start = { x = 10, y = 5, width = 15, height = 10 }
enemy_start = { x = 50, y = 5, width = 15, height = 10 }

[spawn_points]
reinforcements = [
    { position = { x = 35, y = 25 }, delay = 600, faction = "enemy" },
    { position = { x = 15, y = 35 }, delay = 900, faction = "enemy" }
]
```

### Mission Scripts
Lua-based scripting system for complex mission logic:

```lua
function mission_init(mission)
    -- Initialize mission state
    mission.objectives = {
        primary = {
            type = "protect",
            target = "scientist",
            time_limit = 1800,
            completed = false
        }
    }
    
    -- Set up dynamic events
    mission.events = {
        reinforcement_wave = {
            trigger_time = 600,
            executed = false
        }
    }
end

function mission_update(mission, dt)
    -- Check objective conditions
    if mission.objectives.primary.time_limit <= 0 then
        if check_scientist_safety() then
            mission.objectives.primary.completed = true
            trigger_victory()
        else
            trigger_failure()
        end
    end
    
    -- Execute timed events
    if not mission.events.reinforcement_wave.executed and
       mission.elapsed_time >= mission.events.reinforcement_wave.trigger_time then
        spawn_reinforcements()
        mission.events.reinforcement_wave.executed = true
    end
end
```
