## Overview

The Map Tile System defines individual cells within Map Blocks, represented by single characters that encode terrain properties, visual graphics, and gameplay characteristics. Map Tiles serve as the fundamental building blocks for tactical battlefields, providing the data foundation that gets converted into interactive Battle Tiles during map generation. The system enables modular map construction through character-based definitions while supporting extensive visual and gameplay variation.

Map Tiles form the atomic level of map design, controlling everything from basic terrain traversal to complex interactive elements. Data-driven character mappings and tileset references enable extensive modding while maintaining consistent gameplay mechanics across different mission types and environmental themes.

## Mechanics

### Core Properties
Fundamental characteristics defining each map tile's role in tactical gameplay.

#### Character Representation
Single-character encoding for efficient block definition and processing.

**Common Characters:**
- **`.`**: Open ground terrain with standard traversability
- **`#`**: Solid wall or barrier blocking movement and sight
- **`~`**: Water or difficult terrain with movement penalties
- **`^`**: Elevation change affecting positioning and visibility
- **`T`**: Tree or vegetation providing tactical cover
- **`B`**: Building structure with complex interior possibilities

#### Visual Graphics Link
Reference system connecting character representations to visual assets.

**Graphics Mapping:**
- **Tileset Reference**: Pointer to specific tileset file containing visuals
- **Position Coordinates**: Exact location within tileset image grid
- **Animation Support**: Optional frame sequences for dynamic tiles
- **Variation System**: Multiple visual alternatives for environmental variety

#### Gameplay Properties
Core tactical characteristics determining unit interaction and combat.

**Movement Attributes:**
- **Traversability**: Boolean determining if units can occupy the tile
- **Cost Modifier**: Additional action points required for movement
- **Terrain Classification**: Ground, water, air, or special movement types

**Combat Characteristics:**
- **Cover Rating**: Protection value on 0-4 scale for defensive positioning
- **Height Advantage**: Elevation bonus for ranged attack calculations
- **Destruction State**: Whether tile can be damaged or demolished

**Environmental Traits:**
- **Flammability**: Susceptibility to fire-based weapons and effects
- **Sight Blocking**: Interruption of line-of-sight calculations
- **Interactivity**: Ability for units to manipulate or use the tile

### Tile Categories
Organized classification system for different terrain and structural types.

#### Terrain Tiles
Natural landscape and environmental features forming the battlefield foundation.

**Ground Surfaces:**
- **Grass**: Standard outdoor terrain with moderate cover potential
- **Dirt/Sand**: Varied earth types with different movement characteristics
- **Concrete**: Urban hard surfaces with distinct tactical properties
- **Damage Variants**: Cratered or scorched versions of base terrain

**Natural Obstacles:**
- **Rocks/Boulders**: Immovable barriers providing hard cover
- **Debris/Rubble**: Destructible environmental hazards
- **Vegetation**: Trees and bushes offering soft cover options

#### Structure Tiles
Man-made constructions and architectural elements.

**Exterior Barriers:**
- **Concrete Walls**: Heavy structural barriers with high durability
- **Wooden Fences**: Light barriers providing moderate cover
- **Glass Windows**: Transparent barriers with visibility but low durability
- **Security Doors**: Reinforced access points with special interaction

**Interior Features:**
- **Floor Tiles**: Various surface materials affecting movement and sound
- **Stairs/Elevators**: Vertical movement systems with positioning advantages
- **Furniture**: Movable or destructible objects providing cover
- **Equipment**: Interactive terminals and machinery with special functions

#### Special Tiles
Unique elements providing specific gameplay mechanics and objectives.

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Access Points**: Doors, hatches, and entryways with state management
- **Switches/Controls**: Interactive objects triggering environmental changes
- **Containers**: Storage units containing items or hazards
- **Vehicles**: Movable objects providing cover or transportation

**Dynamic Features:**
- **Environmental Hazards**: Toxic spills, electrical fields, or radiation zones
- **Temporary Effects**: Smoke clouds, fire sources, or energy fields
- **Mission Elements**: Objective markers, spawn points, or special triggers

### Tile Integration
Systems for combining tiles into functional map components.

#### Block Assembly
Tile combination process creating 15×15 Map Blocks with coherent layouts.

**Block Construction:**
- **Character Grid**: 15×15 array of tile characters defining layout
- **Thematic Consistency**: Tiles matching block's environmental theme
- **Seam Compatibility**: Edge tiles designed for smooth block connections
- **Anchor Integration**: Special positions for objectives and spawn points

#### Battlefield Conversion
Transformation process converting static Map Tiles to interactive Battle Tiles.

**Enhancement Sequence:**
1. **Property Inheritance**: Transferring static characteristics to battle tiles
2. **Dynamic State Addition**: Adding smoke, fire, and environmental effects
3. **Entity Placement**: Positioning units, objects, and interactive elements
4. **Fog of War Initialization**: Setting up visibility states per faction

#### Visual Rendering
Consistent display system ensuring pixel-perfect tactical representation.

**Rendering Framework:**
- **Tileset Integration**: Loading and displaying appropriate visual assets
- **Grid Alignment**: 20×20 pixel positioning for crisp tactical display
- **Animation System**: Frame-based sequences for dynamic tile behavior
- **Effect Overlay**: Additional visual layers for environmental conditions

## Examples

### Urban Terrain Tiles
City environment tiles supporting complex tactical positioning.

**Tile Composition:**
- **Street Surfaces**: Concrete roads with vehicle interaction possibilities
- **Building Walls**: Concrete barriers with window and door variations
- **Sidewalk Areas**: Mixed concrete and grass with street furniture
- **Alley Spaces**: Narrow passages with dumpster and fire escape features

**Tactical Applications:**
- **Cover Opportunities**: Buildings and vehicles providing hard cover positions
- **Movement Channels**: Streets and alleys creating predictable movement paths
- **Verticality**: Multiple elevation levels with rooftop access
- **Interactive Elements**: Doors, windows, and urban infrastructure

### Rural Environment Tiles
Natural landscape tiles emphasizing environmental interaction.

**Tile Composition:**
- **Grass Fields**: Open terrain with occasional tree clusters
- **Forest Areas**: Dense woods with varying tree types and undergrowth
- **Hill Features**: Elevated terrain with slope and crest variations
- **Water Elements**: Streams, ponds, and marsh areas with movement penalties

**Tactical Applications:**
- **Open Positioning**: Long sight lines enabling ranged combat dominance
- **Natural Cover**: Trees and terrain providing concealment opportunities
- **Elevation Control**: Hills offering defensive and observation advantages
- **Environmental Hazards**: Water features creating movement bottlenecks

### Facility Interior Tiles
