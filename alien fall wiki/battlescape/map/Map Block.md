## Overview

The Map Block System provides a modular approach to tactical map construction, enabling dynamic generation of diverse battlefield environments through composable 15x15 tile building blocks. This system supports procedural map creation while maintaining design control and performance optimization through standardized block formats, intelligent edge matching, and comprehensive validation frameworks.

The modular block system allows for infinite map variety through combination and rotation of standardized blocks, while ensuring seamless connections and balanced tactical gameplay. Blocks serve as the fundamental building units that combine terrain, objectives, and tactical features into reusable components for mission assembly.

## Mechanics

### Block Structure and Properties
Standardized format for consistent modular construction and metadata management:

**Block Dimensions:**
- Standard Size: 15x15 tiles for uniform assembly and predictable scaling
- Tile Resolution: 64x64 pixel tiles for detailed tactical representation
- Block Coverage: 960x960 pixel area per block with consistent boundaries
- Map Scale: Large tactical maps assembled from multiple block combinations

**Block Metadata:**
- Unique Identifier: System-generated or designer-assigned ID for tracking and referencing
- Descriptive Name: Human-readable designation for editor and debugging purposes
- Theme Classification: Urban, rural, industrial, natural categories for thematic filtering
- Difficulty Rating: Easy, medium, hard based on tactical complexity and challenge level
- Tag System: Multiple classification tags for advanced filtering and selection logic

**Block Properties:**
- Connectivity Requirements: Edge compatibility rules for seamless assembly
- Spawn Point Definitions: Designated unit placement locations with faction restrictions
- Objective Markers: Strategic points for mission objectives and interactive elements
- Cover Analysis: Automatic calculation of tactical positioning and defensive opportunities
- Line of Sight: Pre-calculated visibility data for AI optimization and player feedback

### Tile Composition and Rendering
Single-tile architecture with layered rendering for simplified terrain representation:

**Tile Composition:**
- Single Tile Type: Each position has one primary tile type defining terrain, blocking, and destructibility
- Optional Elements: Units, objects, effects, and fog of war overlay the base tile
- Destructibility: Tiles transition through states (e.g., WALL → BROKEN WALL → DESTROYED WALL → GROUND)

**Rendering Priority:**
- Rendering Order: Base tile → optional objects → effects → fog of war for visual layering
- Transparency Handling: Alpha blending for semi-transparent elements and atmospheric effects
- Z-Buffer Management: Depth sorting for proper visual layering and occlusion
- Performance Batching: Group rendering by tile type for efficient GPU utilization

**Tile Properties:**
- Movement Cost: Base action points required for traversal and pathfinding calculations
- Cover Rating: Protection value against incoming fire (none, half, full) for tactical positioning
- Elevation Level: Height differential for line of sight calculations and 3D positioning
- Terrain Type: Ground, water, obstacle, destructible classifications for gameplay logic
- Interactive State: Static, destructible, animated, interactive flags for dynamic behavior

### Map Assembly and Compatibility
Algorithmic system for combining blocks into complete tactical maps with intelligent compatibility:

**Block Selection Algorithm:**
- Theme Filtering: Select blocks matching desired terrain theme and mission requirements
- Neighbor Compatibility: Ensure edge matching with adjacent blocks for seamless connections
- Difficulty Balancing: Maintain consistent tactical challenge across assembled maps
- Connectivity Validation: Guarantee traversable paths to objectives and spawn points
- Procedural Variation: Introduce randomness within design constraints for replayability

**Assembly Constraints:**
- Minimum Connectivity: Ensure player can reach all mission objectives and critical areas
- Edge Compatibility: Match terrain types at block boundaries for visual and gameplay continuity
- Height Continuity: Maintain realistic elevation transitions between adjacent blocks
- Strategic Balance: Distribute cover and tactical features evenly across the battlefield
- Performance Limits: Control total block count for rendering efficiency and memory usage

**Post-Processing Effects:**
- Terrain Blending: Smooth transitions between different terrain types at block boundaries
- Height Normalization: Adjust elevation for appropriate difficulty and accessibility
- Cover Optimization: Enhance or reduce cover based on mission requirements and balance needs
- Path Validation: Ensure AI units can navigate assembled terrain and reach objectives
- Visual Polish: Add environmental details and atmospheric effects for immersion

### Anchor System for Positioning
Named anchor system providing deterministic locations for critical map elements:

**Anchor Types:**
- Player Entry Points: Designated deployment zones with faction and capacity restrictions
- Objective Consoles: Interactive mission objectives requiring specific actions
- Turret Positions: Pre-placed defensive emplacements and automated defenses
- Loot Spots: Valuable items and resources for collection and reward systems
- Special Features: Unique interactive elements and environmental hazards

**Anchor Metadata:**
- Spawn Metadata: Faction, facing direction, capability requirements for appropriate entity placement
- Placement Guarantees: Critical anchors ensure consistent mission geometry and objective accessibility
- Script Integration: Anchors support both procedural generation and scripted mission placement
- Validation Rules: Ensure anchors are accessible and properly positioned within block boundaries

### Rotation and Symmetry Management
Symmetry system for increasing block variety while maintaining logical consistency:

**Symmetry Metadata:**
- Block Flags: Allowed rotations and mirroring options to increase combinatorial possibilities
- Orientation Restrictions: Asymmetric content blocks rotation-sensitive features like one-way doors
- Variety Generation: Rotated/mirrored variants increase map diversity without additional authoring
- Content Preservation: One-way doors, signage, and art respect orientation constraints for logical gameplay

**Deterministic Application:**
- Seeded Selection: Rotation selection uses mission seed for reproducible results across play sessions
- Compatibility Checking: Ensure rotated blocks maintain edge compatibility with neighbors
- Content Validation: Verify that rotated content remains logically consistent and functional

### Block Pool and Selection
Organized block management system for thematic and mission-appropriate selection:

**Terrain Pools:**
- Biome Organization: Blocks organized by biome (Forest_Hills, Urban_Commercial) for thematic consistency
- Mission Filtering: Pool selection based on mission terrain requirements and environmental themes
- Static vs Procedural: Core facility blocks for scripted placement vs generic pools for variety
- Special Assignments: Dedicated blocks for player crafts, UFO bodies, and key mission assets
- Modding Support: TOML-configurable pools and selection rules enabling community content creation

### Placement Validation and Optimization
Comprehensive validation ensuring spatial integrity and gameplay viability:

**Validation Framework:**
- Footprint Reservation: Large blocks prevent overlapping placements and ensure spatial integrity
- Reachability Verification: Seam anchors and navigation markers ensure accessibility and connectivity
- Retry Logic: Alternative block selection when footprints conflict or placement fails
- Provenance Tracking: Complete logging of selection, rotation, and placement decisions for debugging
- Seeded Determinism: Identical seeds produce identical block arrangements for testing and replay

**Performance Optimization:**
- Rendering Optimization: Viewport culling, sprite batching, texture atlasing, LOD systems
- Memory Management: Object pooling, texture caching, block streaming, garbage collection
- CPU Optimization: Pathfinding caching, visibility precomputation, collision detection, threading support

### Modding and Extensibility
