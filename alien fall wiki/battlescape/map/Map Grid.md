## Overview

The Map Grid System implements a 2D array of Map Blocks that defines the overall structure and scale of tactical battlefields. It serves as the intermediate representation between modular Map Blocks and the final playable Battle Grid, providing the framework for assembling coherent and balanced tactical environments. The system enables deterministic map generation through script-driven assembly while ensuring connectivity, playability, and mission-appropriate tactical challenges.

The Map Grid forms the architectural foundation for all tactical maps, controlling battlefield size, terrain distribution, and strategic opportunities. Data-driven block selection and validation processes enable extensive modding while maintaining design consistency and gameplay balance across different mission types and environmental themes.

## Mechanics

### Core Structure
Fundamental organization of the modular battlefield framework.

#### Block Array
Two-dimensional arrangement of Map Blocks forming the tactical layout.

**Grid Properties:**
- **Dimensions**: Width and height in block units (4×4 to 7×7 blocks)
- **Block Resolution**: Each Map Block contains 15×15 tiles (225 tiles total)
- **Total Scale**: Grid dimensions × 15 tiles = final battlefield size
- **Coordinate System**: (0,0) origin at top-left, integer block coordinates

#### Block Relationships
Interconnectivity and compatibility between adjacent Map Blocks.

**Adjacency Rules:**
- **Seam Matching**: Compatible terrain transitions between neighboring blocks
- **Connection Types**: Roads, corridors, doorways, and natural terrain flows
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures logical and playable block combinations
- **Symmetry Support**: Rotated and mirrored blocks maintain proper connectivity

#### Grid Constraints
Limitations and requirements for valid battlefield configurations.

**Size Parameters:**
- **Minimum Scale**: 4×4 blocks (60×60 tiles, 3600 total tactical positions)
- **Maximum Scale**: 7×7 blocks (105×105 tiles, 11025 total tactical positions)
- **Aspect Ratios**: Flexible width-to-height proportions within size limits
- **Mission Scaling**: Different grid sizes corresponding to Battle Size requirements

### Grid Generation Process
Deterministic assembly of Map Blocks into complete battlefield layouts.

#### Script-Driven Assembly
Map Scripts controlling the block placement and validation sequence.

**Assembly Workflow:**
1. **Foundation Placement**: Core structural blocks establishing battlefield framework
2. **Expansion Phase**: Connecting blocks added based on seam compatibility
3. **Area Completion**: Open spaces filled with appropriate thematic blocks
4. **Integrity Validation**: Connectivity and playability verification

#### Block Selection
Algorithmic choice of appropriate Map Blocks for each grid position.

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Seam Compatibility**: Must provide proper transitions with adjacent blocks
- **Thematic Consistency**: Match required biome and terrain characteristics
- **Weighted Probability**: Random selection with designer-controlled likelihoods
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Meet mission-specific layout requirements

#### Validation and Repair
Automated checking and correction of generated grid layouts.

**Validation Systems:**
- **Connectivity Analysis**: All areas must be reachable by standard unit movement
- **Objective Accessibility**: Critical mission points must be reachable
- **Deployment Validation**: Player and enemy spawn zones must be functional
- **Balance Assessment**: Appropriate distribution of cover, objectives, and challenges

### Grid Enhancement
Additional systems for increased tactical complexity and variety.

#### Anchor Integration
Special positions and mission-critical elements placed within the grid.

**Anchor Categories:**
- **Deployment Zones**: Designated starting areas for player and enemy forces
- **Mission Objectives**: Critical interaction points and victory conditions
- **Unit Spawns**: Specific placement locations for reinforcements or events
- **Unique Features**: Special battlefield elements requiring precise positioning

#### Environmental Effects
Dynamic elements integrated into the static grid layout.

**Effect Integration:**
- **Visibility Modifiers**: Fog of war and line-of-sight blocking elements
- **Hazard Placement**: Smoke, fire, and environmental danger zones
- **Interactive Elements**: Destructible objects and usable battlefield features
- **Temporal Events**: Time-based changes and dynamic battlefield evolution

### Conversion to Battlefield
Transformation from abstract Map Grid to interactive tactical environment.

#### Battle Grid Creation
Expansion and enhancement process creating the playable battlefield.

**Conversion Sequence:**
1. **Tile Expansion**: Convert each Map Block's 15×15 tiles to individual Battle Tiles
2. **Property Transfer**: Inherit terrain characteristics and blocking behaviors
3. **State Initialization**: Establish dynamic state containers for all tiles
4. **Entity Integration**: Place units, objects, and environmental effects

#### Performance Optimization
Efficient representation and processing for real-time tactical gameplay.

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Divide large grids into manageable processing chunks
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Generate detailed areas only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Efficient storage and caching of grid data
- **Rendering Systems**: View culling and level-of-detail for large battlefields

## Examples

### Urban District Layout
Complex city environment with interconnected buildings and streets.

**Grid Configuration:**
- **Block Dimensions**: 5×5 blocks creating 75×75 tile battlefield
- **Block Composition**: Mix of street, building, and courtyard blocks
- **Seam Requirements**: Road connections and doorway alignments
- **Anchor Placement**: Building entrances, alley objectives, rooftop positions

**Tactical Characteristics:**
- **Connectivity**: Street networks providing multiple movement routes
- **Cover Distribution**: Buildings offering extensive hard cover opportunities
- **Verticality**: Multiple elevation levels with stairwell connections
- **Objectives**: Multi-building control with civilian evacuation routes

### Rural Terrain Assembly
Open landscape with natural features and terrain variation.

**Grid Configuration:**
- **Block Dimensions**: 6×6 blocks creating 90×90 tile battlefield
- **Block Composition**: Forest, field, and hill terrain blocks
- **Seam Requirements**: Natural transitions and elevation matching
- **Anchor Placement**: Forest clearings, hilltops, river crossings

**Tactical Characteristics:**
- **Open Movement**: Extensive clear areas for flanking maneuvers
- **Natural Cover**: Trees and terrain providing soft cover options
- **Elevation Control**: Hills offering defensive and observation advantages
- **Objectives**: Area denial, resource protection, or ambush scenarios

### Facility Complex Design
Confined indoor environment with structural constraints.

**Grid Configuration:**
- **Block Dimensions**: 4×4 blocks creating 60×60 tile battlefield
- **Block Composition**: Room, corridor, and utility blocks
- **Seam Requirements**: Doorway and hallway connections
- **Anchor Placement**: Security checkpoints, control rooms, ventilation systems

**Tactical Characteristics:**
- **Restricted Movement**: Corridors and doorways creating bottlenecks
- **Interior Cover**: Furniture and structural elements for positioning
- **Security Features**: Locked doors, security cameras, alarm systems
- **Objectives**: Facility lockdown, data retrieval, or sabotage missions
