# Battlescape Map System Design

## Overview

The Battlescape Map System implements a comprehensive, modular approach to tactical battlefield generation and management in Alien Fall. It provides the spatial foundation for all tactical gameplay, combining deterministic generation with extensive modding support to create diverse, balanced combat environments.

The system operates on multiple abstraction layers, from high-level strategic terrain definitions down to individual tactical tiles, ensuring both performance and flexibility. All generation processes are seeded for deterministic, reproducible outcomes across different play sessions and platforms.

## Core Architecture

### Hierarchical Design
The map system uses a layered architecture that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration:

```
Strategic Layer (Geoscape)
    ↓
Terrain Definitions (Biome, Province)
    ↓
Map Generation (Scripts, Blocks)
    ↓
Battle Grid (Interactive Tiles)
    ↓
Tactical Layer (Units, Effects)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Battlefield System** (`Battlefield.md`)
The complete tactical combat environment that integrates all map elements into a cohesive gameplay space. Manages the battlefield lifecycle from generation through resolution, coordinating terrain, units, environmental effects, and mission objectives.

**Key Features:**
- Unified coordinate system for all tactical elements
- Lifecycle management (generation → combat → resolution)
- Multi-layer integration (terrain, units, environment, objectives)
- Fog of war and asymmetric information systems

#### 2. **Battle Grid System** (`Battle Grid.md`)
The detailed 2D array of interactive Battle Tiles that forms the playable tactical battlefield. Converted from the abstract Map Grid through deterministic expansion, providing the spatial framework for all combat interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Variable grid sizes (60×60 to 105×105 tiles)
- 20×20 pixel tile resolution for precise positioning
- Real-time line-of-sight calculations
- Performance-optimized spatial queries

#### 3. **Map Block System** (`Map Block.md`)
Modular 15×15 tile building blocks that serve as the fundamental units for map construction. Enable procedural generation while maintaining design control through standardized formats and intelligent edge matching.

**Key Features:**
- Standardized 15×15 tile format
- Metadata-driven properties (theme, difficulty, connectivity)
- Rotation and symmetry management
- Anchor system for precise positioning

#### 4. **Map Script System** (`Map Script.md`)
Declarative, deterministic recipes that guide map assembly through ordered step sequences. Encode placement heuristics, validation checks, and fallback logic for reliable map generation.

**Key Features:**
- Step-based execution model
- Flag-based conditional logic
- Validation and repair frameworks
- Provenance tracking for debugging

#### 5. **Battle Map Generation** (`Battle Generator.md`)
The complete pipeline that transforms strategic inputs into playable battlefields. Orchestrates the entire generation process from terrain selection through final validation.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-stage deterministic pipeline
- Input gathering and initialization
- Block pool resolution and filtering
- AI preprocessing and spawn placement

#### 6. **Tile and Visual Systems**
- **Map Tile** (`Map Tile.md`): Individual terrain cells with metadata
- **Battle Tile** (`Battle Tile.md`): Interactive grid positions with full game state
- **Tileset** (`Tileset.md`): Visual asset management and rendering
- **Battle Size** (`Battle Size.md`): Grid scaling and dimension management

## Generation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Strategic Context
- Mission parameters (type, difficulty, biome)
- Terrain definition selection
- Map script and block pool resolution

### Phase 2: Map Assembly
- Map script execution with seeded randomness
- Block placement and connectivity validation
- Anchor and objective positioning

### Phase 3: Grid Conversion
- Map Grid → Battle Grid expansion
- Tile metadata inheritance and enhancement
- Interactive element integration

### Phase 4: Tactical Setup
- AI node assignment and pathfinding preprocessing
- Spawn point calculation and validation
- Fog of war initialization

### Phase 5: Final Integration
- Environmental effects placement
- Mission objective activation
- Playability validation and repair

## Design Principles

### Determinism & Reproducibility
- All random processes use seeded generation
- Complete provenance tracking for debugging
- Consistent outcomes across platforms and sessions

### Modularity & Extensibility
- Data-driven configuration throughout
- Standardized interfaces for custom content
- Hierarchical override systems for modding

### Performance & Scalability
- Efficient spatial data structures

- Difficulty scaling through metadata

## Integration Points

### Geoscape Connection
- Province biome determines terrain availability
- Mission parameters drive generation constraints
- Strategic positioning affects deployment zones

### Unit Systems
- Spawn point validation against unit requirements
- Movement calculations using grid properties
- AI pathfinding using preprocessed navigation data

### Combat Resolution
- Line-of-sight calculations for targeting
- Cover analysis for defensive bonuses
- Environmental effects on combat outcomes

### Mission Framework
