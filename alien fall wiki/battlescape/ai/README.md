    id = "corridor_ambush_01",
    position = {x = 15, y = 8},
    type = "ambush",
    tags = {"choke_point", "elevated_position"},
    capacity = 2,
    faction_priorities = {
        enemy_force = 85,

```lua
function calculate_node_priority(node, unit, mission_state, game_state)
    local base_priority = node.faction_priorities[unit.faction] or 50
    
    -- Mission phase modifiers
    if mission_state.phase == "combat" then
        base_priority = base_priority * 1.3
    elseif mission_state.phase == "extraction" then
        base_priority = base_priority * 0.7
    end
    
    -- Environmental factors
    if game_state.has_smoke then
        base_priority = base_priority * 0.8  -- Reduced visibility
    end
    
    if game_state.is_night then
        base_priority = base_priority * 1.2  -- Night time advantage
    end
    
    -- Tactical bonuses
    local cover_bonus = evaluate_cover_quality(node.position)
    local objective_distance = distance_to_nearest_objective(node.position)
    local threat_level = assess_position_threat(node.position, game_state)
    
    return base_priority + cover_bonus - (objective_distance * 0.5) - threat_level
end
```

    SEEK_COVER = "seek_cover",
    OVERWATCH = "overwatch"
}

function update_ai_unit(unit, mission_state, game_state)
    local current_state = unit.ai_state or ai_states.IDLE
    local situation = assess_local_situation(unit, game_state)
    
    -- State transition logic
    local new_state = determine_ai_state(current_state, situation, mission_state)
    
    -- Execute state behavior
    if new_state ~= current_state then
        transition_ai_state(unit, current_state, new_state)
        unit.ai_state = new_state
    end
    
    execute_ai_behavior(unit, new_state, situation, mission_state)
