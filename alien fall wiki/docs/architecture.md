# AlienFall Architecture Hub

This page curates the active Love2D-first architecture references for AlienFall. The legacy Python/PySide6 blueprint remains available for historical research in the `history/` shelf.

## Active Documents
- [`Love2D_Implementation_Plan.md`](./Love2D_Implementation_Plan.md) — End-to-end blueprint covering services, mod loading, data layout, and the development roadmap.
- [`technical/README.md`](./technical/README.md) — Engineering conventions, deterministic data pipeline, tooling, and quality gates.
- [`architecture/ArchitectureSpine.md`](./architecture/ArchitectureSpine.md) — Concise state-stack and service overview for quick onboarding (added in this refresh).

## Archived Material
- [`history/architecture_v1.md`](./history/architecture_v1.md) — Original PySide6/Python architecture kept for context and comparison.

## Maintenance Notes
- Update this hub whenever a major architecture doc moves or is superseded.
- Cross-link new integration diagrams or service catalogs here to keep discovery simple.
