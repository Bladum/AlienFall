## Overview

New Base Building represents the strategic expansion mechanism that transforms tactical victories into lasting operational advantages through the construction of satellite facilities in controlled territories. This system creates meaningful risk-reward decisions around timing, location, and resource investment, establishing forward operating bases that extend detection coverage, provide interception staging areas, and generate additional income streams. By requiring territory control and significant upfront investment, base construction creates natural campaign progression from defensive operations to offensive expansion, with completed bases becoming persistent strategic assets that influence global campaign pacing and player agency.

The construction process involves territory validation, phased development, and risk management, while completed bases integrate seamlessly with existing strategic systems to provide multiplicative benefits.

## Mechanics

### Territory Requirements Framework
Base construction follows strict territorial prerequisites for strategic validity:
- Control Prerequisites: Construction limited to player-controlled provinces
- Security Validation: Territory must be secured through mission success or alien suppression
- Connectivity Rules: Line-of-sight or adjacency requirements to existing controlled territory
- Strategic Positioning: Location influences detection range, interception effectiveness, and alien response patterns
- Terrain Considerations: Coastal access for naval operations, mountainous defensive advantages, urban population bonuses

### Construction Phases and Timing
The building process follows structured phases with deterministic progression:
- Planning Phase: Site survey and initial resource allocation (1-2 weeks)
- Foundation Phase: Basic infrastructure and excavation (2-4 weeks)
- Development Phase: Facility construction and system integration (4-8 weeks)
- Operational Phase: Crew deployment and final activation (1 week)
- Progress Tracking: Resource-dependent advancement rates with milestone validation

### Base Size and Layout Options
Strategic choices in base scale and configuration affect capabilities and timeline:
- Small Bases (3×3 grid): Rapid construction, limited capacity, reconnaissance focus
- Medium Bases (5×5 grid): Balanced timeline, standard facilities, interception capabilities
- Large Bases (7×7 grid): Extended development, maximum capacity, regional command functionality
- Modular Expansion: Facility additions without full reconstruction requirements
- Strategic Templates: Predefined layouts optimized for specific operational roles

### Resource Requirements and Allocation
Construction demands significant resource investment with scaling costs:
- Scaling Costs: Expenses increase with base size and location difficulty modifiers
- Strategic Resources: Alloys, polymers, electronics consumption from global stockpiles
- Personnel Requirements: Dedicated construction teams and specialist allocation
- Ongoing Maintenance: Immediate cost accrual upon construction initiation
- Supply Chain Management: Resource flow tracking and shortage mitigation

### Risk and Interruption System
Construction involves strategic risks that create tension and decision-making:
- Alien Attack Threats: Combat interruptions from geoscape mission outcomes and regional activity
- Environmental Hazards: Terrain-based events triggered by province biome and weather systems
- Resource Shortages: Supply line disruptions from interception failures and alien raids
- Sabotage Events: Infiltrated activities linked to undetected province missions
- Risk Mitigation: Strategic timing aligned with geoscape patrol patterns and mission schedules

### Facility Deployment and Sequencing
Construction follows logical facility prioritization for operational readiness:
- Core Facilities Priority: HQ, power, living quarters constructed first for basic functionality
- Defensive Facilities: Prioritized in high-threat areas for immediate protection
- Specialized Facilities: Labs, workshops added based on strategic priorities
- Connectivity Requirements: Facility placement respecting adjacency and service dependencies
- Expansion Capabilities: Modular additions without disrupting existing operations

### Operational Activation Process
Bases transition from construction to operational status through structured activation:
- Core Completion Threshold: Base becomes operational once essential facilities complete
- Crew Deployment: Transportation requirements from existing bases
- Training Period: Local adaptation and facility familiarization time
- Gradual Ramp-up: Phased operational increase to avoid personnel overwhelm
- Service Integration: Progressive activation of interconnected base systems

### Strategic Benefits and Advantages
Completed bases provide multiplicative strategic advantages:
- Detection Expansion: Extended radar coverage and interception range
- Economic Generation: Income from local population and resource extraction
- Research Acceleration: Scientific community bonuses and analysis capabilities
- Operational Efficiency: Reduced response times and transportation costs
- Strategic Flexibility: Multiple staging areas and complex patrol patterns

## Examples

### Base Template Examples
Forward Recon Post: 3×3 grid, 4 weeks construction, $500K cost, HQ/Radar/Living Quarters focus on extended detection. Interception Hub: 5×5 grid, 8 weeks construction, $1.5M cost, HQ/Hangar/Workshop/Radar for craft staging. Research Outpost: 5×5 grid, 10 weeks construction, $2M cost, HQ/Laboratory/Living Quarters/Power for scientific acceleration. Defensive Stronghold: 7×7 grid, 12 weeks construction, $2.5M cost, HQ/Laser Defense/Barracks/Radar as regional defense anchor. Industrial Complex: 7×7 grid, 14 weeks construction, $3M cost, HQ/Workshop/Storage/Power for manufacturing capacity.

### Construction Risk Scenarios
High-Threat Province: 70% alien activity from mission density, 21% attack probability from interception failures, 15% environmental risk, 10% resource shortage risk. Mountainous Terrain: 1.5x difficulty multiplier, 15% environmental risk, extended timeline from accessibility. Urban Center: 0.8x difficulty multiplier, population bonuses, research advantages, reduced environmental risks. Coastal Province: Naval access capabilities, amphibious staging, moderate environmental risks from weather and tides.

### Resource Requirement Scaling
Small Base: $150K alloys, $100K electronics, $75K polymers, $175K funding for 3×3 grid with basic facilities. Medium Base: $450K alloys, $300K electronics, $225K polymers, $525K funding for 5×5 grid with standard facilities. Large Base: $900K alloys, $600K electronics, $450K polymers, $1.05M funding for 7×7 grid with full facilities. Difficulty Multipliers: Mountainous +50%, Desert +20%, Urban -20%, High Alien Activity +30%.

### Strategic Benefit Calculations
Detection Range: +25% coverage area per forward base, cumulative stacking with existing bases. Income Generation: $50K-200K monthly based on population center size and development level. Research Bonus: +15% discovery rate from local scientific communities, +10% analysis speed. Interception Efficiency: 40% reduction in response time, 60% increase in patrol coverage area.
