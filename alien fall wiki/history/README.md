# Historical Documentation Archive

## Overview

The history folder contains archived versions of documentation that have been superseded by newer designs but remain valuable for understanding project evolution, design rationale, and historical decision-making context.

## Files in This Section

- [architecture_v1.md](architecture_v1.md) - Original architectural design (archived)

## Purpose

Historical documentation serves several important functions:

- **Design Evolution Tracking**: Understanding how systems evolved over development
- **Decision Context**: Preserving rationale for major architectural changes
- **Reference Material**: Comparing current and historical approaches
- **Learning Resource**: Studying iteration cycles and refinement processes
