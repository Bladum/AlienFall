## Overview

The Alien Strategy layer represents the supreme command structure of the alien invasion in Alien Fall, operating as an invisible meta-AI that coordinates multiple campaigns across factions, regions, and timescales. This system transforms individual campaigns from isolated events into a cohesive invasion narrative, ensuring strategic coherence while maintaining emergent gameplay. Data-driven and seeded for deterministic behavior, the strategy layer monitors player progress, allocates resources dynamically, and adapts invasion tactics to create compelling long-term challenges.

### Key Design Principles

- **Unified Invasion Narrative**: Creates coherent alien behavior across all campaigns
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Allocates limited alien resources based on strategic priorities
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Learns from player patterns and adjusts invasion strategy
- **Faction Autonomy with Coordination**: Maintains faction-specific behaviors while serving overall goals
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create sophisticated strategic behaviors

## Mechanics

### Strategic Objectives

The strategy layer pursues hierarchical objectives that evolve with campaign progression:

- **Territorial Control**: Establish and maintain control over key provinces and regions
- **Resource Acquisition**: Secure alien resources through mining, abduction, and base construction
- **Technological Advancement**: Research and deploy advanced technologies against player defenses
- **Player Disruption**: Target player infrastructure, supply lines, and strategic assets
- **Escalation Management**: Gradually increase invasion intensity while maintaining sustainability

### Campaign Orchestration

Manages the lifecycle and interactions of multiple concurrent campaigns:

- **Campaign Activation**: Triggers new campaigns based on strategic conditions and resource availability
- **Priority Assignment**: Ranks campaigns by strategic importance and resource allocation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Manages overlapping campaigns in shared regions
- **Termination Logic**: Ends campaigns when objectives are met or resources become unsustainable
- **Success Metrics**: Evaluates campaign effectiveness and feeds back into strategy adaptation

### Resource Allocation

Distributes finite alien resources across competing campaigns and operations:

- **UFO Fleet Management**: Assigns craft to scouting, combat, or transport roles
- **Unit Deployment**: Allocates alien forces to high-priority campaigns
- **Technology Distribution**: Prioritizes research and equipment upgrades
- **Energy Budgeting**: Manages power requirements for bases, portals, and advanced operations
- **Recovery and Reinforcement**: Routes salvaged resources back into strategic reserves

### Adaptive Intelligence

Learns from player behavior and campaign outcomes to refine strategy:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies player tactics, base locations, and interception patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates threat levels from player technology and military strength
- **Tactical Adjustment**: Modifies campaign parameters based on observed player responses
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepares fallback strategies for major setbacks
- **Long-term Learning**: Accumulates knowledge across campaign phases for improved decision-making

### Faction Coordination

Ensures faction-specific behaviors contribute to overall invasion goals:

- **Specialization Respect**: Maintains unique faction capabilities and weaknesses
- **Cooperative Objectives**: Aligns faction campaigns toward common strategic goals
- **Resource Sharing**: Facilitates inter-faction resource transfers when beneficial
- **Conflict Mediation**: Resolves faction disputes that threaten invasion cohesion
- **Unified Escalation**: Coordinates faction-specific escalation events for maximum impact

## Examples

### Early Game Scouting

Strategy layer focuses on reconnaissance and establishing presence:

- Activates scouting campaigns in multiple regions to map player bases and radar coverage
- Allocates limited UFO resources to probe detection ranges and interception capabilities
- Coordinates faction-specific scouting (e.g., aquatic factions survey coastal provinces)
- Builds strategic intelligence database for future campaign planning

### Mid-Game Escalation

Increases pressure while adapting to player defenses:

- Launches coordinated campaigns targeting player weak points identified during scouting
- Allocates resources to technology research based on observed player equipment
- Adjusts tactics when players develop advanced interception or base defenses
- Introduces new factions or escalates existing ones based on strategic assessment

### Late-Game Crisis

Commits maximum resources to decisive operations:

- Orchestrates multi-faction assaults on key player positions
- Deploys advanced technologies and elite units to overwhelmed regions
- Implements contingency strategies when major campaigns fail
- Pursues victory conditions through base destruction or territory domination
