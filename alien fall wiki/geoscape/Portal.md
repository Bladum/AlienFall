## Overview
The Portal system establishes interdimensional and specialized gateways enabling instant craft travel between distant provinces across different worlds, bypassing conventional adjacency restrictions. Portals represent advanced alien technology, mystical phenomena, and engineering achievements that create strategic shortcuts while introducing stability risks, capacity limitations, and technology requirements.

Portals provide dramatic, gated mechanisms for inter-world travel that expand campaign scope when activated. They serve as discrete objects with discovery and activation phases, enabling designers to script narrative arcs and pacing around inter-world access. Portal endpoints link to province points, preserving geographic continuity while offering new logistics and strategic choices once active.

## Mechanics
### Portal Discovery and Activation
Portals exist as dormant interdimensional links between provinces in different worlds, revealed through research breakthroughs, mission completions, or random events. Discovery requires specific research technology, with activation normally demanding research completion or tactical missions to secure and power the device. Activation is atomic and deterministic, changing portal state from dormant to active.

### Portal Travel Rules
Active portals establish links from source provinces on one world to a destination province on another world. Travel bypasses normal adjacency restrictions and distance calculations, reducing transit from days/weeks to instant or minutes. Transit executes through the campaign scheduler, consuming configurable resources including transit days and fuel. Craft ordering reserves the craft for transit duration, becoming unavailable until arrival.

### Portal Stability and Risks
Portals exhibit random failure chances based on stability ratings and usage history. Failed travel results in craft damage, crew injury, or random province displacement. Stability improves through research and equipment, with risk mitigation via specialized craft modifications and facilities. Predictive assessment provides risk evaluation before travel commitment.

### Portal Capacity and Cooldown
Portals restrict crafts per time period with size-based capacity consumption and post-usage recovery periods. Larger crafts consume more capacity and require extended cooldowns. Portal networks distribute usage across multiple gateway points, with facilities and research increasing throughput and reducing cooldown times.

### Facility-Based Portal Access
Base constructions enable portal travel from specific geographic locations. Gateway facilities provide basic access with standard stability, stabilizer facilities reduce instability and risks through enhanced field generation, and anchor facilities enable stable multi-world portal networks with superior reliability.

### Control and Permissions
Portal control semantics declare who may use portals, whether they can be re-targeted, and ownership transfer rules. Access control and political effects integrate with diplomacy, funding, and transfer systems. Per-portal configuration includes transit modifiers, allowed craft types, required permits, capacity limits, and special world overrides.

## Examples
### Portal Discovery Scenarios
Research breakthrough reveals dormant portal location on Earth. Tactical mission tasks squad with breaking through alien guardians to power the device and activate it. Seismic activity activates underwater portal connecting oceanic provinces.

### Portal Travel Applications
Portal reduces 7-day transatlantic flight to 5-minute transit. Earth-to-Mars portal enables instant travel with 0 fuel cost but 10% failure risk. Underwater network connects Pacific trenches in 30 minutes versus 2-week surface transit.

### Stability and Risk Cases
Unstable portal with 40% failure chance displaces craft to random adjacent province on failure. Natural portal with 25% failure risk causes minor craft damage. Stabilized portal with 5% failure chance causes crew injury only on failures.

### Capacity and Cooldown Examples
Basic portal supports 3 crafts per hour with 15-minute cooldown between activations. Major hub handles 10 crafts per hour with 5-minute cooldown, supporting large craft sizes. Facility portal enables 5 crafts per hour with 8-minute cooldown and enhanced stability bonuses.

### Strategic Portal Usage
Player sends Skyranger through portal to place crafts and personnel at linked province on alien homeworld to found forward base. Portal activation enables base establishment, permanent rebasing, or temporary projection of hangar assets and forces between worlds.
