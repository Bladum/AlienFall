## Overview

Energy serves as a per-unit resource system in Alien Fall that gates powered actions, energy-based equipment, and sustained abilities independently from Action Points. The system enables separate pricing of endurance and burst capabilities, encouraging multi-turn tactical planning and resource management.

Energy pools, regeneration rates, and consumption costs are fully data-driven and deterministic, supporting predictable gameplay, reliable testing, and comprehensive modding. The system promotes strategic decisions about when to use high-energy abilities and how to manage resource recovery.

## Mechanics

### Core Properties

Each unit has fundamental energy attributes that define their power capacity.

Energy Pool:
- MaxEnergy: Maximum energy capacity determining power ceiling
- CurrentEnergy: Current stored energy (always â‰¥ 0)
- Regeneration: Energy restored at end of turn (fixed amount or percentage)
- Deterministic Updates: All changes are predictable and reproducible

Regeneration Mechanics:
- End-of-Turn Restore: Automatic recovery after unit's turn completes
- Default Rate: 25% of MaxEnergy per turn (configurable)
- Seeded Randomness: Any variability uses named seeds for consistency
- Provenance Logging: All regeneration events recorded for debugging

### Action Costs and Gating

Actions consume energy with strict gating to prevent overuse.

Consumption System:
- Explicit Costs: Each action declares required energy amount
- Authoritative Check: TryConsumeEnergy() validates availability
- Consumption Timing: Energy deducted at action resolution
- Provenance Tracking: All consumption logged with context

Gating Rules:
- Hard Block: Actions blocked if CurrentEnergy < cost
- No Partial Use: Insufficient energy prevents action execution
- Penalty Options: Some actions allow reduced effects for partial energy
- UI Feedback: Clear indication of blocked actions and energy requirements

### Consumption Categories

Different action types have appropriate energy costs for balance.

Movement Energy:
- Standard Movement: Base energy cost per AP spent
- Sprint/Run Mode: Multiplied energy cost for enhanced speed

## Examples

### Basic Regeneration

Standard energy recovery over multiple turns:

- Unit Profile: MaxEnergy 8, regeneration 25% (2 energy per turn)
- Turn 1: Spend 6 energy on actions, end with 2 energy
- End of Turn 1: Regenerate +2, total becomes 4 energy
- Turn 2: Can perform moderate actions with 4 energy base
- Planning: Player can calculate exact energy availability for next turn

### Movement and Combat

Combined AP and energy costs for tactical movement:

- Energy Rate: 1 energy per AP spent on movement
- Action Sequence: Move 2 AP (2 energy) + fire 2 pistol shots (2 Ã— 6 = 12 energy)
- Total Cost: 14 energy consumed in one turn
- Regeneration: +2 energy at turn end (25% of 8)
- Net Result: Significant energy investment requires recovery planning

### Sprint and Heavy Fire

High-energy tactical options with recovery considerations:

- Sprint Cost: 3 energy per AP (3Ã— normal rate)
- Action Combo: Sprint 2 AP (6 energy) + Plasma Cannon shot (25 energy)
