## Overview
The Transformations system provides permanent or temporary modifications to unit capabilities through surgical, biological, chemical, or technological interventions. Transformations represent significant character development choices with substantial costs, risks, and long-term consequences, creating meaningful progression and specialization opportunities. They are high-impact augmentations installed into a dedicated slot that alter long-term capabilities through passive modifiers or activatable abilities.

Transformations require specialized facilities and resources, with installation as a scheduled operation involving downtime and deterministic recovery outcomes. They are first-class data objects with clear compatibility tags, provenance logging, and UI previews to help players understand tradeoffs before committing. The system supports both permanent commitments and designer-enabled reversibility, with all effects and processes being data-driven and reproducible.

## Mechanics
### Transformation Categories and Effects
Transformations span multiple categories including enhancement (technological augmentations), combat (battlefield specializations), biological (organic modifications), psi (psionic enhancements), and chemical (temporary modifications). Effects include stat modifications, ability grants, trait integration, and resistance adjustments, with passive and active capability types.

### Application Process and Scheduling
Transformations require research prerequisites, specialized facilities, and trained personnel. Installation starts a scheduled operation reserving facility capacity and resources, with fixed procedure durations and recovery periods. Operations include deterministic injury outcomes and health monitoring, with queuing systems for multiple transformations and resource reservation mechanics.

### Compatibility and Prerequisites
Each transformation declares compatible race tags and required class tags, with optional prerequisites including research IDs, facility levels, or possession of specific items. Compatibility prevents contradictory combinations while maintaining design flexibility, with validation checking race/class tags and stat requirements before allowing installation.

### Duration and Persistence
Transformations can be permanent (lifetime effects), temporary (fixed duration with expiration), or conditional (situation-dependent persistence). Permanent transformations create lasting character identity, temporary ones enable tactical flexibility, and conditional transformations respond to health thresholds, environmental factors, or combat triggers.

### Reversibility and Removal
Some transformations are permanent commitments while others allow reversal procedures with associated costs and risks. Reversible transformations enable experimentation and character retconning, though reversal procedures consume resources and may cause complications. Irreversible transformations create high-stakes strategic decisions.

### Resource Costs and Investment
Transformations require substantial credit costs, material resources, facility time, and specialist personnel. Costs scale with complexity and rarity, with bulk discounts for multiple procedures. Resource investment encourages strategic planning and creates economic pressure on base management.

### Visual and Identity Changes
Transformations alter physical appearance through portrait changes, armor modifications, accessory additions, and size alterations. Animation effects reflect capability changes, with transition animations enhancing transformation moments. Visual changes create distinctive character identities and provide immediate feedback on modifications.

### Mutually Exclusive Combinations
Transformations may conflict directly or through category exclusions, preventing redundant stacking and maintaining balance. Effect conflicts, resource competition, and biological incompatibility create trade-off decisions, while category limits encourage focused specialization paths.

## Examples
### Permanent Enhancement Transformation
Soldier undergoes cybernetic enhancement after reaching experience thresholds and completing technical training. System validates compatibility, deducts credits and neural implants, reserves cybernetics lab for procedure duration, applies intelligence and reaction bonuses, grants interface abilities, provides psi resistance, and updates visual appearance. Transformation becomes permanent character identity with full provenance logging.

### Triggered Combat Transformation
Unit drops below health threshold during combat, automatically activating berserker rage transformation. System applies strength and damage bonuses for limited duration, grants unstoppable ability with immunity to suppression, increases psi vulnerability, and logs activation with reproducible seeding. Effect expires when conditions end or duration completes.

### Temporary Chemical Transformation
Unit receives combat stimulant injection during mission preparation. System applies reaction time and accuracy bonuses for fixed duration, increases morale, adds poison vulnerability, tracks countdown timer, and automatically removes effects upon expiration. Temporary nature enables flexible tactical deployment without permanent commitment.

### Biological Size Modification
Human soldier undergoes gene therapy for size increase. System validates race compatibility and health prerequisites, consumes credits and biological materials, reserves bio lab capacity, changes size category, applies strength bonus with mobility penalty, adds metabolism trait, enables large equipment compatibility, and provides optional reversal capability.

### Reversible Psi Amplification
Psionically sensitive unit undergoes neural enhancement. System checks trait prerequisites and ability requirements, deducts credits and psi amplifiers, applies potency increases, grants mind control and telekinesis abilities, adds psi vulnerability, marks as reversible with reversal costs, and prevents incompatible technology combinations.
