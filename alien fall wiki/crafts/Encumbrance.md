# Craft Encumbrance System

> **ðŸ“– Master Reference:** For a comprehensive overview of capacity systems across all game layers, see [Capacity Systems](../core/Capacity_Systems.md). This document focuses specifically on craft-level cargo and unit capacity in the operational layer.

## Overview

The craft encumbrance system uses the same simple binary restriction approach as unit equipment. Crafts have two separate capacity systems: cargo capacity for items and weapons, and unit capacity for personnel. Any loadout exceeding these capacities cannot be equipped or used, creating strategic tradeoffs without complex penalty systems.

The system maintains clear and predictable gameplay by enforcing hard limits during craft configuration. Cargo capacity determines what equipment can be mounted, while unit capacity determines how many personnel can be transported based on their size classifications.

## Mechanics

### Cargo Capacity

Crafts have a cargo capacity that limits the total weight of mounted items and weapons.

Capacity Types:
- Item Capacity: Total weight limit for weapons, addons, and equipment
- Size-Based: Each craft class has a defined cargo capacity value
- Equipment Weight: All mounted items contribute to total cargo weight
- Validation: Total equipment weight must not exceed cargo capacity

Capacity Examples:
- Small Fighter: 5 cargo capacity units
- Medium Fighter: 8 cargo capacity units
- Heavy Bomber: 15 cargo capacity units
- Transport: 20 cargo capacity units

### Unit Capacity

Crafts have a separate unit capacity that limits personnel transport based on unit size.

Capacity System:
- Unit Size Classes: Units classified as size 1, 2, or 4
- Capacity Tracking: Total unit sizes cannot exceed craft's unit capacity
- Size Examples: Standard soldier (size 1), heavy trooper (size 2), mech (size 4)
- Validation: Sum of unit sizes must not exceed unit capacity limit

Capacity Examples:
- Small Fighter: 2 unit capacity (2 size-1 units or 1 size-2 unit)
- Medium Fighter: 4 unit capacity (4 size-1 units or 1 size-4 unit)
- Heavy Bomber: 8 unit capacity
- Transport: 20 unit capacity

### Loadout Validation

Craft configuration validation occurs during equipment and crew assignment.

Validation Process:
- Cargo Check: Total equipment weight compared to cargo capacity
- Unit Check: Total unit sizes compared to unit capacity
- Binary Result: Configuration either accepted or rejected
- No Penalties: No performance penalties - simply cannot equip overweight loadouts

Validation Features:
- Real-time Feedback: Immediate validation during craft configuration
- Clear Messages: "Over capacity - cannot equip" with breakdown
- Component Highlighting: Problematic items or units clearly marked
- Resolution Guidance: Suggestions for lighter equipment or smaller crews

## Examples

### Cargo Capacity Examples

Equipment validation for craft cargo capacity:

- Small Fighter: Cargo capacity 5 units
- Equipment Load: Light cannon (2), sensor suite (2), armor plating (1)
- Total Weight: 5 units exactly
- Validation Result: Loadout accepted, equipment can be mounted
- UI Feedback: Green checkmark, "Cargo loadout valid"

- Medium Fighter: Cargo capacity 8 units
- Equipment Load: Heavy cannon (4), missile launcher (3), sensor suite (2)
- Total Weight: 9 units (exceeds 8 capacity)
- Validation Result: Loadout rejected, cannot equip or use items
- UI Feedback: Red X, "Over cargo capacity - cannot equip" with weight breakdown

### Unit Capacity Examples

Personnel validation for craft unit capacity:

- Transport Craft: Unit capacity 12
- Crew Load: 8 size-1 soldiers + 2 size-2 heavy troopers
- Total Size: 8Ã—1 + 2Ã—2 = 12 exactly
- Validation Result: Crew assignment accepted
- UI Feedback: "Unit capacity valid"

- Small Fighter: Unit capacity 2
- Crew Load: 1 size-1 pilot + 1 size-2 heavy trooper
- Total Size: 1 + 2 = 3 (exceeds 2 capacity)
- Validation Result: Crew assignment rejected, cannot deploy
- UI Feedback: "Over unit capacity - cannot assign" with size breakdown
