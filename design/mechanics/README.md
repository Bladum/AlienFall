# Game Mechanics Specifications - Hex-Based Systems

## Goal / Purpose

The Mechanics folder contains detailed design specifications for all game systems and mechanics. These documents define how each system works, what parameters control behavior, balance values, and the relationships between systems.

**üéØ CRITICAL:** All spatial systems use **vertical axial hex coordinate system**. See `hex_vertical_axial_system.md` for complete specification.

## Content

System design files for each major game mechanic:

- **hex_vertical_axial_system.md** ‚≠ê - **Universal coordinate system (READ FIRST)**
- **Units.md** - Unit classes, abilities, progression systems
- **Battlescape.md** - Tactical combat mechanics (hex-based) and turn resolution
- **Geoscape.md** - Strategic layer, world map (90√ó45 hex grid), and campaign progression
- **Basescape.md** - Base construction (hex layout), facility management, and upgrades
- **Economy.md** - Financial systems, resources, and production
- **Crafts.md** - Spacecraft types, capabilities, and specifications
- **Items.md** - Equipment, weapons, armor, and consumables
- **AI_Systems.md** - AI decision-making (hex pathfinding) and behavior systems
- **Politics.md** - Political systems, diplomacy, and faction relations
- **Gui.md** - User interface design and interaction patterns
- **Finance.md** - Financial mechanics and budgeting
- **Analytics.md** - Data collection and telemetry systems
- **Assets.md** - Asset management and resource handling
- **Lore.md** - Story content and world-building
- **Integration.md** - System integration patterns
- **Interception.md** - UFO interception and air combat
- **3D.md** - 3D rendering and graphics systems
- **Glossary.md** - Game terminology and concepts
- **Overview.md** - Overview of all mechanics

## Coordinate System

**ALL game layers use vertical axial hex coordinates:**
- **Format:** `{q, r}` (axial coordinates)
- **Directions:** E, SE, SW, W, NW, NE (6 directions)
- **Core Module:** `engine/battlescape/battle_ecs/hex_math.lua`
- **Usage:** Battlescape (combat), Geoscape (world), Basescape (facilities)

## Features

- **Complete System Specifications**: Every game system documented
- **Hex-Based Design**: All spatial calculations use hex math
- **Detailed Mechanics**: How systems work step-by-step
- **Balance Parameters**: Numbers that control game balance
- **Configuration Format**: TOML structure for each system
- **Integration Points**: How systems interact (all use same hex system)
- **Examples**: Usage examples and sample data
- **Rationale**: Why certain design decisions were made

## Integrations with Other Systems

### API Documentation

- Balance parameters stored in configs match these values

### Testing & Validation
- Test cases verify mechanic behavior
- Mock data follows mechanic specifications
- Balance tests ensure parameters work as designed

### Lore & Content
- Mechanics support narrative progression
- Story context provided in lore documents
- Content created using mechanic specifications
