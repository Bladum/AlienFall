## Executive Summary

AlienFall demonstrates **well-isolated systems with explicit integration points**. The architecture uses three independent layers (Geoscape/Basescape/Battlescape) that communicate through state passing and data transformation. Systems are **loosely coupled horizontally** (independent operation possible) but **tightly coupled vertically** (layers depend on underlying layer outputs).

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Coupling Level** | Medium-Low | Good modularity with clear boundaries |
| **Integration Patterns** | 4 primary patterns | Consistent approach to cross-system communication |
| **Circular Dependencies** | None detected | Clean architecture, no cycles |
| **Data Flow Complexity** | High (by design) | Intentional; reflects game design requirements |
| **System Independence** | High (horizontal) | Each system functional in isolation |
| **Vertical Dependency** | High (by design) | Strategic layer depends on tactical results |

## Data Flow Analysis

### Mission Lifecycle Overview

The mission lifecycle consists of 5 sequential phases:

**Phase 1: Geoscape Mission Generation & Detection**
- Faction AI decides to generate mission based on threat level and escalation
- Mission created with type, location, unit composition, and difficulty scaling
- Cover value calculated (high initially, degrades as player detects it)
- Radar coverage checked - if detected, mission visible to player; otherwise hidden
- Mission stored with all metadata for future deployment

**Phase 2: Interception (Optional)**
- Player deploys craft to intercept UFO
- Aerial combat occurs between craft and UFO
- Three outcomes possible: UFO destroyed (no ground mission), UFO escapes (continue to ground), UFO damaged (difficulty reduced)
- Craft damage recorded and UFO salvage generated

**Phase 3: Battlescape Tactical Combat**
- Map procedurally generated from biome type, script template, and mission type
- Player units deployed alongside allied forces (if applicable)
- Enemy units positioned based on mission parameters
- Combat proceeds in turn order: Player → Allied units → Enemy units → Environmental effects
- Actions resolve: movement, accuracy calculations, damage application
- Objectives tracked for mission success/failure determination
- Mission outcome calculated with casualties, XP, salvage, and fame delta

**Phase 4: Basescape Salvage Processing**
- Salvage received: items, resources, prisoners, armor
- XP distributed to participating units, potentially triggering promotions
- Items stored in inventory for equipping or selling
- Resources converted to usable materials
- Prisoners offer research opportunities or intelligence bonuses
- Unit health recovery managed through hospital queues
- Mission rewards increase country funding and player fame
- Research projects unlocked from captured alien technology
- Manufacturing becomes available from new research

**Phase 5: Geoscape Strategic Impact**
- Mission success increases funding from supporting country
- New capabilities from Basescape manufacturing feed back to Geoscape
- Escalation adjusted based on mission success/failure
- Difficulty scaling increases for next missions based on escalation level
- Cycle repeats with next mission generation

## Coupling Classification

### Horizontal Coupling (Same-Layer Systems)

**Geoscape Systems**:
- `geoscape/provinces.lua` ↔ `geoscape/countries.lua` - **Tight** (provinces belong to countries)
- `geoscape/countries.lua` ↔ `politics/` - **Medium** (diplomacy affects relations)
- `geoscape/` ↔ `economy/` - **Medium** (missions generate funding context)
- `geoscape/` ↔ `ai/strategic/` - **Medium** (AI generates missions)

**Basescape Systems**:
- `basescape/facilities/` ↔ `basescape/base_manager.lua` - **Tight** (adjacency, service management)
- `basescape/` ↔ `economy/marketplace.lua` - **Medium** (purchasing, pricing)
- `basescape/` ↔ `battlescape/units.lua` - **Medium** (unit stats, equipment)

**Battlescape Systems**:
- `battlescape/units.lua` ↔ `battlescape/combat/` - **Tight** (unit actions, combat resolution)
- `battlescape/map/` ↔ `battlescape/systems/` - **Tight** (terrain, LOS, movement)
- `battlescape/` ↔ `battlescape/ai/tactical/` - **Tight** (enemy unit control)

### Vertical Coupling (Cross-Layer)

- **Geoscape → Basescape** - **One-Way** (strong dependency; Basescape must process mission outcomes)
- **Basescape → Geoscape** - **One-Way** (feedback; capabilities feed back to strategy)
- **Battlescape → Basescape** - **One-Way** (salvage & XP generation)
- **Basescape → Battlescape** - **One-Way** (unit composition, equipment)
- **Geoscape → Battlescape** - **One-Way** (mission context)

### Circular Dependency Analysis

**No Circular Dependencies Detected**:
- Geoscape generates missions without reading Battlescape state
- Battlescape consumes Geoscape context without affecting it
- Basescape processes Battlescape output and feeds back to Geoscape
- Clear upstream/downstream relationship maintained

**Assessment**: ✅ **Healthy architecture with no circular dependencies**

## System Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: State Passing (Primary)

**Usage**: Passing data from one layer to another without persistent connection

**Example Flow**: Geoscape prepares mission context (type, location, difficulty, enemies, objectives) and passes it to Battlescape. Battlescape then operates independently with that passed state, generating its own internal subsystems without requiring ongoing communication with Geoscape.

**Coupling**: **Low** - Geoscape doesn't know Battlescape internals; just passes well-defined data

**Affected Systems**: Geoscape ↔ Battlescape, Battlescape ↔ Basescape

---

### Pattern 2: Event Publishing (Secondary)

**Usage**: Systems emit events when important changes occur

**Example Flow**: Battlescape concludes mission and publishes "mission_complete" event with results. Basescape subscribes to this event and processes salvage automatically without Battlescape needing to know who's listening.

**Coupling**: **Low** - Event publisher doesn't know subscribers; decoupled communication

**Affected Systems**: Battlescape → Basescape, Geoscape → All systems

---

### Pattern 3: Query Interface (Tertiary)

**Usage**: Systems query another system's state without modification

**Example Flow**: Battlescape loads player units by querying Basescape for each unit ID. For each unit, Battlescape queries equipped items and equipment stats, then uses those stats for combat calculations.

**Coupling**: **Medium** - Battlescape depends on Basescape interface stability

**Affected Systems**: Battlescape ← Basescape, Geoscape ← Basescape

---

### Pattern 4: Callback / Listener (Quaternary)

**Usage**: Systems register callbacks for specific events

**Example Flow**: Geoscape registers a callback for "mission_complete" events. When Battlescape publishes mission results, Geoscape's callback triggers automatically, updating country relations and processing mission impact without direct coupling.

**Coupling**: **Low** - Geoscape doesn't directly call Battlescape

**Affected Systems**: Strategic impact propagation, Feedback loops

---

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Data Flow Bottlenecks

1. **Mission Generation** (Geoscape → Battlescape)
   - **Frequency**: Once per mission
   - **Size**: ~5-10 KB mission data
   - **Performance**: Negligible (<1ms)

2. **Map Generation** (Battlescape internal)
   - **Frequency**: Once per battle
   - **Size**: ~50-100 KB map data
   - **Performance**: Significant (100-500ms); intentional one-time cost

3. **Salvage Processing** (Battlescape → Basescape)
   - **Frequency**: Once per mission conclusion
   - **Size**: ~2-5 KB salvage data
   - **Performance**: Low (<10ms)

4. **Unit State Synchronization** (Basescape ↔ Geoscape)
   - **Frequency**: Monthly (on-demand queries)
   - **Size**: ~1-2 KB capability summary
   - **Performance**: Minimal (<5ms)

### Optimization Opportunities

- ✅ **Current**: No obvious bottlenecks detected
- ⚠️ **Potential**: Map block generation could cache pre-generated layouts
- ⚠️ **Potential**: Mission generation could pre-compute difficulty scaling
- ⚠️ **Future**: Large campaign states might benefit from database persistence

## Dependency Resolution Strategies

### Strategies for Adding New Systems

**New System Checklist**:
- [ ] Identify layer (Geoscape/Interception/Battlescape/Basescape/Economy/AI)
- [ ] Define input interface (what data does it consume?)
- [ ] Define output interface (what data does it produce?)
- [ ] Map dependencies (what other systems must exist first?)
- [ ] Establish integration points (which existing systems does it connect to?)
- [ ] Design test cases (how do we verify integration?)

**Example: Adding "Espionage" System**

Espionage is strategic layer system depending on Geoscape and Politics. Input: Organization funds and target country. Output: Intelligence information (reduces mission cover by 5-20 points). Integration points: affects mission cover in Geoscape, impacts country relations in Politics system. Test cases: verify espionage reduces cover correctly, verify funds deducted from budget, verify country relations affected appropriately.
