# Finance & Funding Mechanics

## Funding Sources

- Monthly national subsidies keyed to relation level (1–10 → 10 K–125 K cr) adjusted by satellite coverage (
    +10 % per coverage tier) and economic policies (+15 % MIG-run).
- Mission rewards: easy 5–10 K, medium 15–30 K, hard 40–60 K, with salvage value separately tracked.
- Diplomatic aid packages triggered by favors or events; repayable with 10–20 % interest if cash negative.
- R&D grants (per breakthrough) 15–25 K tied to research branch; manufacturing sales yield 50–70 % margin vs shop price.

## Expense Categories

- Personnel: salaries, hazard pay for deployed squads, training/maintenance; scales with base count and tier.
- Facilities: upkeep per structure; power shortages double costs until resolved.
- Logistics: craft fuel/repairs, satellite maintenance, mission staging.
- Strategic operations: diplomacy, espionage, covert operations, black market expenses.

## Balance Mechanics

- Monthly net gain requirement scaled by difficulty (Easy −20 % expenses, Normal baseline, Hard +15 % expenses, Impossible +30 % expenses).
- Reserves >500 K earn 2 % interest; <50 K impose morale penalty −5 and staff attrition chance.
- Automated warning levels: Low (reserve <300 K) triggers advisory, Critical (<100 K) suspends nonessential spending, Insolvency (negative + 3 months) triggers forced cuts or loss.

## Reroll & Budget Control

- Strategic reroll costs 10 K and resets monthly funding/diplomatic options; limited to once per month.
- Budget committee approvals required for >200 K off-schedule expenditures; meeting fails if loyalty <30.
- Conditional funding requests: medium (+25 K) require favor cost; major (+100 K) requires mission success pledge.

## Payment Flow & Audits

- All incomes recorded in daily ledger; expenses are immediate, funding dispersed at month end.
- Audit events check accounts; failing due to undocumented spending results in −20 relation with contributors.

## Victory & Loss Links

- Financial insolvency (three consecutive months negative beyond −500 K) is campaign loss.
- Surplus >1 M unlocks expansion options and reduces panic globally by 5.
