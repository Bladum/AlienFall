## Overview

### System Architecture

Geoscape is the strategic global layer where players manage their covert organization on a world scale. It operates on monthly cycles with asynchronous turn-based gameplay, where actions have realistic time delays and consequences ripple through the global theater. The system emphasizes strategic positioning, resource allocation, and long-term planning in response to escalating alien threats.

**Design Philosophy**

Geoscape creates meaningful strategic depth through interconnected systems: base placement affects radar coverage and interception range; diplomatic relations influence funding and mission availability; craft positioning determines response capability. The monthly timescale encourages careful planning while maintaining engagement through procedurally generated events and escalating threats.

**Core Principle**: Global strategic management with territorial control and resource optimization.

## World Map System

### Hexagonal Grid

The world is represented as a 90Ã—45 hexagonal grid, with each hex representing approximately 500km of Earth territory. Hexes are organized into provinces (groups of 6-12 hexes) and regions (collections of provinces sharing cultural/geographic characteristics).

**Hex Properties**
- **Terrain**: Affects movement costs, base construction viability, and mission generation
- **Population**: Influences mission frequency and diplomatic importance
- **Resources**: Strategic materials available for base construction and research
- **Ownership**: Country affiliation affects diplomatic relations and funding

**Map Generation**
- Procedural continent formation with realistic geography
- Strategic choke points and defensible positions
- Balanced resource distribution across regions
- Cultural and political boundaries reflecting real-world divisions

### Province System

Provinces serve as the primary territorial unit for strategic gameplay:

**Province Control**
- One base per province (exclusive territorial occupation)
- Province ownership affects regional diplomacy
- Control provides access to local resources and population
- Loss of control triggers diplomatic penalties

**Strategic Value**
- Population density affects funding potential
- Geographic position influences interception coverage
- Resource availability impacts base efficiency
- Political alignment affects mission generation

---

## Base Management

### Base Placement Strategy

Bases are permanent installations providing operational hubs for the player's organization. Strategic placement is critical for maximizing radar coverage, interception range, and resource access.

**Placement Rules**
- One base per province maximum
- Construction requires clear hex (no mountains, cities, or alien bases)
- Adjacent hexes provide adjacency bonuses
- Distance from other bases affects operational efficiency

**Base Functions**
- **Radar Coverage**: Detection radius for UFOs and missions
- **Craft Operations**: Launch/recovery facilities for spacecraft
- **Resource Processing**: Salvage refinement and storage
- **Personnel Housing**: Unit recruitment and training facilities

### Base Expansion

Bases grow through facility construction and territory control:

**Growth Mechanics**
- Initial construction establishes core facilities
- Expansion adds specialized capabilities
- Territory control extends operational range
- Research unlocks advanced base technologies

---

## Craft System

### Craft Types

Crafts are the player's mobile assets capable of global deployment, interception, and ground operations.

**Craft Categories**
- **Interceptors**: Fast, lightly armed craft for air-to-air combat
- **Transports**: Heavily armed craft for ground deployment and salvage
- **Heavy Transports**: Large capacity craft for base construction and major operations
- **Specialized Craft**: Research vessels, stealth craft, and experimental designs

**Craft Statistics**
- **Speed**: Movement points per turn on geoscape
- **Range**: Operational distance before requiring refuel
- **Capacity**: Number of units or equipment carried
- **Weapons**: Air-to-air combat effectiveness
- **Armor**: Damage resistance in combat

### Movement & Deployment

Craft movement follows realistic aviation mechanics with fuel consumption and maintenance requirements.

**Movement System**
- Hex-based movement with terrain modifiers
- Fuel consumption based on distance and craft type
- Maintenance cycles requiring base downtime
- Weather effects on operational capability

**Deployment States**
- **Base**: Stationed at friendly base, ready for immediate launch
- **Transit**: Moving between locations, vulnerable to interception
- **Mission**: Engaged in active operations
- **Recovery**: Returning to base, reduced capability

## Mission System

### Mission Types

Missions represent alien activities requiring player intervention, generated procedurally based on global threat levels and player actions.

**Primary Mission Types**
- **UFO Crash Recovery**: Salvage alien technology from crashed spacecraft
- **Terror Missions**: Protect civilian populations from alien attacks

**Mission Parameters**
- **Difficulty**: Based on alien technology level and player preparedness
- **Time Limit**: Mission expiration affects success/failure consequences
- **Rewards**: Salvage value, research data, diplomatic impact
- **Risks**: Unit casualties, base damage, diplomatic penalties

### Mission Generation

Missions spawn based on algorithmic threat assessment:

**Generation Factors**
- **Alien Activity Level**: Higher threat increases mission frequency
- **Player Detection**: Undetected UFOs generate crash recovery missions
- **Geographic Factors**: Population centers attract terror missions
- **Diplomacy Status**: Friendly nations request assistance missions

## Detection & Radar

### Radar Coverage System

Radar systems provide the primary method of detecting alien activity, with coverage determined by base placement and technology level.

**Radar Mechanics**
- **Coverage Radius**: Detection range in hexes from base location
- **Detection Probability**: Chance to spot UFOs within range
- **False Positives**: Weather and terrain affect accuracy
- **Technology Bonuses**: Research improves detection capability

**Detection States**
- **Undetected**: UFO operates freely, may complete missions
- **Detected**: UFO visible on geoscape, interception possible
- **Tracked**: UFO position and trajectory known
- **Intercepted**: Player craft engaged with UFO

### Stealth & Counter-Detection

Advanced alien craft employ stealth technology requiring upgraded detection systems.

**Stealth Mechanics**
- **Stealth Level**: UFO ability to avoid radar detection
- **Detection Threshold**: Required radar technology to spot craft
- **Jamming**: Some UFOs can temporarily disable local radar
- **Terrain Masking**: Geographic features provide natural concealment

## Diplomacy & Relations

### Country Relations System

Diplomatic relations with global powers provide funding, resources, and strategic advantages.

**Relation Levels**
- **Allied**: Full funding, shared intelligence, joint operations
- **Friendly**: Standard funding, marketplace access, mission requests
- **Neutral**: Reduced funding, limited marketplace, occasional missions
- **Unfriendly**: Minimal funding, restricted access, diplomatic penalties
- **Hostile**: No funding, blocked territories, active opposition

**Relation Modifiers**
- **Mission Success**: Successful operations improve relations
- **Alien Activity**: Failed missions damage diplomatic standing
- **Base Placement**: Strategic positioning affects local relations
- **Economic Support**: Funding levels influence diplomatic warmth

### Funding Mechanics

Countries provide monthly funding based on diplomatic relations and economic factors.

**Funding Formula**
```
Funding = GDP Ã— Funding_Level Ã— Relation_Modifier Ã— Alien_Threat_Multiplier
```

**Funding Parameters**
- **GDP**: Country economic output (static value)
- **Funding Level**: Government allocation to anti-alien programs
- **Relation Modifier**: Diplomatic standing adjustment
- **Threat Multiplier**: Increased funding during high alien activity
