# Politics & Reputation Mechanics

## Fame Loop

- Range 0-100 in four tiers (Unknown, Known, Famous, Legendary); higher tiers unlock premium suppliers, special mission chains, and +10% to +50% monthly funding bonuses.
- Gains: +5 per mission success, +2 per UFO kill, +3 per research breakthrough, +15 per scripted victory; losses: -10 when a base is raided, -5 for collateral casualties, -20 if black market dealings are exposed.
- Fame decays by 1-2 per idle month; any mission, research, or story event resets the decay counter.
- Legendary fame raises alien aggression by roughly 30% and multiplies black market discovery checks, so visibility is both asset and liability.

## Karma Alignment

- Hidden scale from -100 (malevolent) to +100 (benevolent) defines alignment tiers: Evil, Ruthless, Pragmatic, Neutral, Principled, Saint.
- Positive acts such as rescues, prisoner mercy, or humanitarian sorties add +5 to +15; negative acts like executions, torture, or illegal raids subtract 3 to 30 based on severity.
- Alignment gates mission availability, advisor reactions, supplier willingness, and late-game endings; crossing plus or minus 75 effectively locks trajectory without deliberate counterplay.

## Diplomacy and Relations

- Shared relation scale of -100 to +100 with light time decay (-0.5 per inactive month); actions and events apply -10 to +10 swings.
- Countries: relation level drives mission cadence (-50% at hostile, +30% at allied), monthly funding (-80% to +50%), base construction rights, and elite recruitment access.
- Suppliers: pricing shifts from 1.5x at hostile to 0.5x at +100; stock availability runs 25%-150%; delivery speeds improve to minus five days at VIP tier, embargo at -100 blocks all orders.
- Factions: lower relations increase mission volume and unit buffs (+20% health and +15% damage), while alliances unlock truces and reduce reinforcements.
- Diplomatic actions (treaties, trade deals, conflict mediation) cost credits scaled by relation tier and can be halved through the Minister of Diplomacy advisor.

## Black Market Hooks

- Monthly event chance equals region base rate (20%-50%) multiplied by alignment and fame modifiers; ruthless alignments in contested regions routinely hit 60%-70% offers.
- Event buckets: rare item sales (40%), clandestine missions (25%), raids (20%), corrupt officials (10%), rescue or mercy opportunities (5); each carries fame and karma adjustments.
- Discovery risk grows with fame and repeated participation; exposure costs -20 fame, -5 to -20 cross-faction relations, +15% marketplace prices, and triggers three to six months of investigations.

## Power Point Economy

- Monthly baseline is 1 power point plus bonuses: major victories +3 to +5, treaties +2, technology breakthroughs +1; catastrophic setbacks subtract 3 to 5.
- Power points fund advisor hires (4-20 each), organization level milestones (current level times five plus five), emergency levers, and exclusive technology unlocks.
- Points never decay; campaign pacing expects 20-40 stored by midgame and 50-100 or more entering late stages.

## Advisor System

- Eight core specialists (CTO, CFO, COO, Intelligence Director, Military Commander, Minister of Diplomacy, Chief Engineer, Quartermaster) span tiers: Junior 4-6 PP, Senior 6-10 PP, Elite 10-15 PP, Legendary 15-20 PP with 500-8000 credits monthly upkeep.
- Recruitment delay is one strategic month; advisor slots start at three and expand at organization levels three, five, seven, and nine.
- Synergy sets activate automatically when pairs are employed: Finance Team, War Machine, Intelligence Network, Research Division, Logistics Expert; bonuses multiply with individual effects.
- Dismissal costs 75% of a monthly salary and minus 20 relation with the advisor's patron faction; rehiring later adds a 20% point surcharge, while retirements or poaching events can remove advisors outright.

## Organization Levels

- Levels one through ten require mixed achievements (mission wins, credits earned, alliances, base count) plus the level-up power point fee; for example, level five asks for 50 victories, 250000 credits, three allies, four bases, and 20 points.
- Unlock cadence grants more bases (up to ten), advisor slots, elite research branches, faction alliances, secret technology, and endgame arcs; enemies scale in response with elite deployments from level four upward and multi-faction wars after level seven.

## Difficulty and Testing Hooks

- Easy difficulty boosts fame gain, softens relation penalties, and increases power point income; Hard and Impossible invert those multipliers and accelerate fame decay.
- Recommended regression checks: fame climb from five victories (+25 expected), treaty cost scaling across relation tiers, black market discovery probability at high fame, advisor synergy activation after relevant hires, and organization level gating once power point thresholds are met.
