# Black Market Summary

## Access Gates

- Discovery requires fame 25+, karma ≤+40, a trigger event, and a 10K buy-in; monthly upkeep 5K keeps contacts warm.
- Higher tiers demand both fame and descending karma (Standard at fame 50/karma ≤0, Enhanced 75/≤−50, Complete 95/≤−75).

## Inventory & Pricing

- Catalog rotates weekly across weapon mods, illicit tech, rare resources, merc contracts, and covert mission leads.
- Prices = base × tier multiplier (1.1–1.75) before negotiation perks (up to −30%). Larger orders and repeated purchases push detection risk upward.

## Karma & Fame Impact

- Each transaction shifts karma −5 to −20; mission outcomes can add fame (successful spectacle) or slash it (public scandal −30).
- Maintaining black market reliance drags alignment toward Evil, locking in darker narrative routes.

## Mission Hooks & Consequences

- Exclusive missions pay huge rewards and unlock unique gear but risk diplomatic fallout (relations −20 to −40) and tier loss on failure.
- Detection triggers audits (25-50K fines, facility downtime) or international ultimatums to shutter operations.

## Strategic Role & Testing

- Provides a shortcut around research/manufacturing bottlenecks at the cost of ethics, stability, and political goodwill.
- QA watchlist: access gating thresholds, karma/fame adjustments per event, detection probability scaling with volume, and tier downgrade logic after failed missions or neglect.
