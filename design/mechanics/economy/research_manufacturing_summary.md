# Research & Manufacturing Summary

## Research Operations

- Projects consume man-days, scientist salary, and prerequisite items; cost ranges 50-600 man-days before campaign randomizer multiplies by 0.5-1.5.
- Facility upgrades and specialist bonuses shave 10-30% time; scientist efficiency drops after the 4th contributor (5th at 80%, 10th at 60%).
- Progress pauses without loss; cancelling refunds 50-75% credits while retaining partial completion for restart.
- Technology tree splits across weapons, armor, alien tech, facilities, and support with tiered dependencies (e.g., Laser Tech requires Precision Firearms + Alien Power Systems).

## Manufacturing Pipeline

- Unlocks follow research completion; engineers convert raw resources (fuel, alloys, elerium) into components and finished goods.
- Workshops provide man-days: small 10/day, large 30/day before adjacency/upgrades; stopping production preserves progress.
- Batch orders (≥5 units) gain 20% speed; advanced workshops reduce build time by up to 40% and lower resource waste.
- Marketplace purchases cost 100-150% of base price for instant delivery; in-house production costs 50-70% but ties up facilities and storage.

## Resource & Storage Management

- Tiered materials unlock via research (fusion cores, warp crystals); storage caps (100/400/800) block salvage intake when full.
- Transfer system moves assets between bases with travel time and security risk; power shortages or damaged facilities can halt queues.
- Testing priorities: randomizer bounds, diminishing return curve on scientists, batch manufacture speed bonus, storage overflow handling, and marketplace vs manufacturing profit comparisons.
