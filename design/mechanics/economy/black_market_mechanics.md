# Black Market Mechanics

## Access & Reputation

- Unlock sequence: reach fame 25, karma ≤+40, encounter discovery event, pay 10 K entry fee.
- Fame thresholds: 25 (Restricted), 50 (Standard), 75 (Enhanced), 95 (Complete); karma must drop correspondingly to 0, −25, −50, −75.
- Contact maintenance cost 5 K/month; neglect causes access decay and resets tiers.

## Inventory & Pricing

- Item categories: weapon mods, rare resources, illicit tech, mercenary contracts, covert missions.
- Pricing baseline = base cost × tier modifier (1.1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75); negotiation perks can cut prices up to −30 %.
- Stock refresh weekly; event-driven surges can flood certain goods but raise exposure risk.
- Purchases adjust karma (−5 to −20) and may shift fame ± depending on mission outcomes.

## Mission Hooks

- Exclusive missions: assassinations, smuggling, jailbreaks, exotic hunts, facility raids; grant high payouts but risk major diplomatic penalties.
- Failure can strip tiers, trigger penalties (−30 fame, −40 karma) and spawn retaliation events.
- Success yields unique tech, rare resources, or elite recruits otherwise inaccessible.

## Enforcement & Detection

- Detection chance increases with volume; cumulative risk tracked per month resets after cooldown.
- Captured contraband causes audits (major fine 25–50 K, relation loss, possible facility downtime).
- Diplomatic pressure events demand shutting down operations or sacrificing relations/funding.

## Integration with Core Economy

- Black market purchasing bypasses research prerequisites but raises tech parity challenges.
- Enables alternate economic strategy balancing high risk/high reward vs standard funding reliability.
