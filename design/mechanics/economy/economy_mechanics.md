# Economy & Production Mechanics

## Monthly Cashflow

- Funding sources: country stipends (50–60 %), mission rewards (30–40 %), salvage conversion (10–20 %), manufacturing sales (5–10 %).
- Funding tiers per country derived from relation level (1–10 → 10 K–125 K cr; modifiers 0.5× to 1.5×).
- Baseline expenses: personnel salaries 35–45 %, facility upkeep 30–40 %, craft ops 10–15 %, research/manufacturing queues remainder.
- Difficulty modifiers: Easy +20 % funding/−20 % missions; Normal baseline; Hard −20 % funding/+30 % missions; Impossible −40 % funding with doubled alien sorties.
- Crisis levels escalate when monthly deficit persists: Stress (−20 % funding, +20 % missions), Crisis (−40 %, heavy demands), Collapse (−60 %, country exits) until recovery triggers (successful missions, diplomatic aid, three quiet months).

## Resource Pipeline

- Raw materials: fuel, metals, electronics, biomatter; advanced tiers unlocked by research (fusion cores, elerium, warp crystals).
- Manufacturing chains convert resources into components then final equipment; batch crafting (≥5 units) grants +20 % speed.
- Storage limits enforced via facility capacity (100/400/800 items); overflow halts salvage intake until space freed.

## Manufacturing Operations

- Workshops yield man-days: small 10, large 30 (modifiable by upgrades and adjacency bonuses).
- Projects consume credits, time, and resources; cancellation refunds 50 % progress, retains research unlocks.
- Advanced workshops reduce build times: standard speed baseline, upgraded −20 %, master −40 %.
- Marketplace vs manufacturing: buying costs 100–150 % base price for instant delivery; in-house production costs 50–70 % but consumes time/resources.

## Marketplace & Trading

- Suppliers categorized: Military Supply (baseline), Syndicate Trade (premium gear), Exotic Arms (alien tech), Research Materials, Tactical Network, Black Market (illegal goods).
- Pricing formula = base price × (market fluctuation −50 %…+50 %) × supplier markup (0.8×…1.5×) × relation multiplier.
- Reputation discounts up to −50 %; scarcity or events adjust ±3–20 %. Bulk purchases grant 5–15 % rebates.
- Certain items require tech prerequisites; unavailable inventory greyed until research completes.

## Black Market Access

- Requirements: karma ≤+40, fame ≥25, discovery event, 10 K entry fee.
- Access tiers: Restricted (items only), Standard (+units/services), Enhanced (+illegal missions), Complete (+assassinations). Higher tiers demand lower karma (down to −75).
- Purchases impact karma (−5 to −20) and may unlock unique missions with high rewards and reputational risk.

## Power Points & Advisors

- Power points accrue monthly (base 1, modifiers from victories/events); spent on advisor hiring (cost 5–15 pts) or organisational upgrades (10–50).
- Advisors provide persistent bonuses (e.g., Military Commander +10 % damage/+20 % mission success) with salaries 500–8 000 cr/month; incompatibilities reduce effectiveness 5–10 % if ignored.

## Economic Stress States

- Financial crisis triggers equipment degradation, morale penalties, and research halts; bankruptcy (three months <−500 K) is loss condition.
- Markets respond: hostile suppliers cut stock 50 %, allied suppliers expand 50 %; funding drops 30 % on losing streak, grows with positive streaks.

## Analytics & Reporting

- Monthly report aggregates income, expenses, storage utilisation, manufacturing throughput, resource changes, and projected runway.
- Scenario modelling ensures 90 % mission success rate required to remain solvent on Normal difficulty.
