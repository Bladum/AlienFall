# Items & Equipment Systems

## Category Structure

- Five core pillars: resources, lore items, unit gear, craft fittings, and prisoners; each obeys unique storage, research, and karma rules.
- Resource tiers unlock by campaign phase (Fuel/Metal → Fusion/Titanium/Uranium → Elerium/Alloys → Zrbite/Aqua Plastic → Warp Crystal/Rift Matter → Quantum/Reality tech), feeding manufacturing, facility power, and craft range.
- Lore artefacts are weightless narrative keys that gate research trees and cannot be sold; prisoners function as living items with facility slots, research hooks, and karma outcomes (release vs sale).

## Equipment Stats & Capacity

- Every physical item tracks price bands (supplier relation ±150%-20%), weight (unit carry 6-12, craft 20-100), storage space (facility limited), and research gates for purchase, use, and manufacture.
- Unit loadouts obey class requirements; mismatches impose -30% accuracy while matched roles gain bonuses (Medic + Medikit +50% healing, Specialist avoids heavy weapon penalties).
- Synergy grid links armor classes (light/medium/heavy/specialized) with weapon weight: matched kits grant accuracy or armor efficiency, mismatches trim defense, speed, or aim per defined tables.

## Durability & Maintenance

- Gear durability spans 0-100 with condition bands (Pristine→Critical) and tiered performance penalties; destroyed items at 0 vanish permanently.
- Degradation sources: weapons lose 5 per mission, armor -3 per hit (modifiers by armor type), environments add ±1-2, specialist users accelerate wear.
- Repairs cost 1% item price per durability point, consume workshop days (10 durability/day) or instant supplier repairs at 50% premium; modifications drain 5 durability on installation.

## Modification & Customization

- Weapon slots (2) and armor/utilities (1) accept researched mods that stack multiplicatively; consumables/resources cannot be modified.
- Mutually exclusive options (scope vs laser, plating vs lightweight alloy) enforce trade-offs, while removal is free and reuses parts if done before destruction.
- Mod suites enable archetypes: precision (scope + stock), suppression (rapid-fire + extended mag), stealth (silencer + ghillie), tanking (ceramic + reactive plating).

## Acquisition & Logistics

- Inventory rules enforce class, capacity, and research checks before equipping; any item can be thrown for 1 AP, but armor locks at deployment.
- Crafts mount weapons and systems in fixed hardpoints with no inflight refits, consume fuel straight from base stores, and cannot launch if reserves are insufficient.
- Base management loops include manufacturing chains, synthesis recipes (e.g., Metal + Fuel → Titanium), trading at 50% resale, and black market buys that trade karma for rare stock.

## Economic & Balance Hooks

- Durability upkeep and supplier pricing tie items to monthly budgets, reinforcing the economy design (high-tier plasma gear demands hefty repair spend).
- Karma and fame drive supplier inventories, black market access, and prisoner handling outcomes, ensuring equipment choices interact with diplomatic systems.
- Testing priorities: validate durability decay across environments, synergy math for armor/weapon combos, modification exclusivity, resource phase progression, and craft loadout impacts on interception pacing.
