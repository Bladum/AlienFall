## OVERVIEW

AlienFall uses a unified damage type system with 8 core types, each with specific armor resistances.

---

## DAMAGE TYPES

### 1. KINETIC
- **Source**: Firearms, ballistic weapons, melee impact
- **Description**: Physical projectile or impact damage
- **Armor Resistance**:
  - Light Armor: 50% reduction
  - Medium Armor: 30% reduction
  - Heavy Armor: 10% reduction
  - Energy Shield: 0% reduction
- **Weapon Examples**: Rifles, pistols, shotguns, melee weapons

---

### 2. EXPLOSIVE
- **Source**: Grenades, explosives, mines, blast radius
- **Description**: Concussive blast and shrapnel damage
- **Base Armor Resistance** (applies to units):
  - Light Armor: 40% reduction
  - Medium Armor: 20% reduction
  - Heavy Armor: 5% reduction
  - Energy Shield: 50% reduction
- **Weapon Examples**: Grenades, mines, rocket launchers, proximity explosives
- **Wave Mechanics**: Blast creates separate damage waves in each direction (see Explosion Wave Mechanics below)

#### EXPLOSION ARMOR MECHANICS (Detailed)

**Different Treatment for Walls vs. Units**:

**Walls & Obstacles**:
- **Damage Blocked**: 100% (walls completely block explosion waves)
- **Wave Propagation**: Blast waves stop at wall (do not penetrate or reduce)
- **Adjacent Hexes**: Hexes on opposite side of wall receive NO damage
- **Design Intent**: Walls provide complete protection from explosion (tactical positioning matters)

**Units** (with armor):
- **Damage Blocked**: 50% (armor reduces explosion damage)
- **Resistance Calculation**: Unit armor blocks 50% base, then additional armor-type resistance applies
- **Wave Propagation**: Unit does not stop wave (wave continues to hexes beyond unit)
- **Adjacent Units**: Units behind first unit still take damage from blast wave

**Wave Propagation Mechanics**:
```
Explosion at epicenter with radius 4 hexes

Direction 1 (toward wall):
  Hex 1: Clear â†’ Takes 100% damage
  Hex 2: Clear â†’ Takes 80% damage (distance penalty)
  Hex 3: Wall â†’ BLOCKED (0% damage to hexes beyond)

Direction 2 (open field):
  Hex 1: Unit (light armor) â†’ Takes 40% damage (50% blocked + 40% armor resistance)
  Hex 2: Clear â†’ Takes 80% damage (distance penalty)
  Hex 3: Unit (heavy armor) â†’ Takes 30% damage (50% blocked + 5% armor resistance)
  Hex 4: Clear â†’ Takes 60% damage (distance penalty)

Direction 3 (through multiple units):
  Hex 1: Unit (armor) â†’ Takes 40% damage (wave continues)
  Hex 2: Unit (armor) â†’ Takes 35% damage (cumulative distance + prior unit presence)
  Hex 3: Clear â†’ Takes 70% damage (distance penalty)
```

**Key Design Points**:
- Walls completely stop explosions (binary: full block or no block)
- Units reduce but don't stop explosions (wave continues beyond units)
- Multiple waves propagate independently in each cardinal direction
- Each direction has separate line-of-sight checks and distance calculations
- Distance penalties apply within each direction separately

**Example Scenario** (Grenade with Force 10, Radius 4):
```
Base Damage: 10
Distance Scaling: 100% at hex 1, 80% hex 2, 60% hex 3, 40% hex 4

Direction 1 (North - open field):
  Hex 1: Unit with light armor (40% resistance)
    - Base: 10 damage
    - Armor blocks: 50%
    - Light armor: 40% additional resistance
    - Taken: 10 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 0.6 = 3 damage
  Hex 2: Clear
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.8 = 8 damage
  Hex 3: Unit with heavy armor (5% resistance)
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.6 = 6 damage
    - Armor blocks: 50%
    - Heavy armor: 5% additional
    - Taken: 6 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 0.95 = 2.85 â‰ˆ 3 damage

Direction 2 (East - toward wall):
  Hex 1: Clear
    - Base: 10 damage
  Hex 2: Clear
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.8 = 8 damage
  Hex 3: Stone wall
    - BLOCKED (0% damage to hexes beyond wall)

Direction 3 (South - open field):
  Hex 1: Clear
    - Base: 10 damage
  Hex 2: Clear
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.8 = 8 damage
  Hex 3: Clear
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.6 = 6 damage
  Hex 4: Clear
    - Base: 10 Ã— 0.4 = 4 damage

Direction 4 (West - open field):
  [Similar to Direction 3]
```

## ARMOR MATERIALS & RESISTANCES

| Armor Type | Kinetic | Explosive | Energy | Psi | Stun | Acid | Fire | Frost |
|------------|---------|-----------|--------|-----|------|------|------|-------|
| **Light** | 50% | 40% | 20% | 0% | 70% | 30% | 40% | 50% |
| **Medium** | 30% | 20% | 40% | 0% | 50% | 50% | 50% | 40% |
| **Heavy** | 10% | 5% | 60% | 0% | 30% | 70% | 60% | 20% |
| **Reinforced** | 25% | 30% | 50% | 0% | 40% | 45% | 55% | 35% |
| **Alien Tech** | 15% | 35% | 70% | 20% | 20% | 40% | 50% | 45% |

**Key Notes**:
- Psi damage ignores all standard armor (0% reduction for all)
- Special armor types (Psi Shield, Insulated, Acid-Resistant, etc.) provide specific bonuses
- Modders can define custom armor combinations
- Armor effectiveness = Base Damage Ã— (1 - Resistance%)

---

## SHIELD MECHANICS

Energy shields layer on top of armor:

| Shield Type | Kinetic | Explosive | Energy | Psi | Stun | Acid | Fire | Frost |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|-----|------|------|------|-------|
| **Standard** | 40% | 50% | 80% | 0% | 40% | 0% | 30% | 50% |
| **Advanced** | 50% | 60% | 90% | 30% | 50% | 20% | 40% | 60% |
| **Alien** | 60% | 70% | 95% | 60% | 60% | 40% | 50% | 70% |

**Shield Priority**: Shields absorb damage first, then remaining damage hits health/armor

---

## WEAPON ASSIGNMENT

### Faction Weapons by Damage Type

**Human**:
- Kinetic: Rifles, pistols (primary)
- Explosive: Grenades, mines
- Stun: Shock weapons (special training)
- Fire: Flamethrowers (support)

**Alien** (varies by species):
- Energy: Plasma weapons (common)
- Psi: Mind-based attacks (strong aliens)
- Acid: Acid sprayers (melee aliens)
- Stun: Paralysis (specialized aliens)

---

## ACCURACY IMPACT

Damage type does NOT affect accuracy directly. Accuracy calculation based on:
- Unit stat (Aim)
- Weapon bonus
- Cover modifier
- Range modifier
- Visibility

All damage types use same accuracy formula.

---

## FIRE MODES & DAMAGE SCALING

| Fire Mode | Damage | Spread | Accuracy Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Single Shot | 1.0Ã— | 0 | +20% accuracy |
| Burst | 0.8Ã— per round | 5Â° spread | Normal accuracy |
| Full Auto | 0.6Ã— per round | 10Â° spread | -15% accuracy |
| Charged (Energy) | 1.5Ã— | 0 | -10% accuracy (charging time) |

---

## CRITICAL NOTES

### For Implementers
- Damage calculation: BaseDamage Ã— (1 - ArmorResistance%) = FinalDamage
- Multiple armor types: Use best single armor resistance (not cumulative)
- Shields then armor: Shields reduce first, remaining damage reduced by armor
- Special ammo types can modify damage (e.g., "Incendiary Rounds" = Fire damage boost)

### For Modders
- Custom damage types: Engine supports adding custom types beyond these 8
- Custom armor types: Define via armor definitions with resistance percentages
- Resistance tables: Fully configurable per mod
- Balancing: Consider that Psi bypasses armor (design accordingly)

### For Designers
- Weapon variety: Mix damage types to require diverse armor strategies
- Difficulty scaling: Stronger enemies use more varied damage types
- Late-game progression: Introduce special armor types to counter specific threats
