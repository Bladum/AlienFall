# Morale, Bravery & Sanity Loop

## Stat Foundations

- Bravery (6-12) sets mission-start morale and adds psionic defense; modified by traits (Brave +2, Coward -3), ranks (+1 per 3 promotions), equipment, and situational buffs/debuffs.
- Morale begins equal to Bravery and never exceeds it; robots ignore morale entirely (locked at 12).
- Sanity mirrors core stat scale, varies by role (Medics 12, Psionics 6), and acts solely as a deployment gate—no combat penalties until it hits zero.

## In-Mission Morale Flow

- Stress events drain morale: allied deaths, damage, flanks, night horror, commander loss, and first-contact scares (-1 to -2 each).
- Thresholds impose accuracy/AP penalties: 4 nervous (-5% acc), 3 stressed (-10%), 2 shaken (-1 AP, -15%), 1 panicking (-2 AP, -25%), 0 panic (no actions, 10% flee, 5% drop weapon).
- Recovery uses Rest (2 AP → +1 morale) and leader rally (4 AP → +2 morale, once/turn); leader aura grants +1 morale per turn within 8 hexes, kills add +1 to shooter.

## Between-Mission Sanity Loop

- Mission templates apply sanity losses (standard 0, moderate -1, hard -2, horror -3) with additive triggers (night -1, ally deaths, civilian losses, mission failure, base assault, new horror types).
- Sanity states govern deployment only: 8-12 stable, 5-7 stressed, 2-4 fragile, 1 critical (still deployable), 0 broken (locked out until treated).
- Recovery pipeline: passive +1/week (+1 extra with Temple), counseling +2-3/visit (100 cr), leave +5 over 2 weeks (5K cr), promotions/missions restore +1-2.

## Strategic Implications

- Separate morale (tactical tempo penalty) from sanity (strategic roster management) to force squad rotation and facility investment.
- Monitor sub-4 sanity units for benching, build Temple early for doubled recovery, and leverage large rosters to absorb horror campaign spikes.
- Testing priorities: morale drain stacking, panic behaviors, rest/rally AP costs, sanity loss accumulation during horror chains, and recovery pacing against campaign calendar.
