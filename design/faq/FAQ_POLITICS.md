## Fame vs Karma System

### Q: What's the difference between Fame and Karma?

**A**: **Two separate reputation systems** (like **Fallout: New Vegas** dual reputation).

**Fame (Public Reputation)**:
- **Visible**: Everyone sees your fame
- **Range**: 0-100
- **What it represents**: How well-known you are
- **How to gain**: Complete missions, win battles, save civilians
- **Effects**: Unlocks suppliers, diplomatic options, higher-tier missions

**Karma (Hidden Morality)**:
- **Hidden**: Only you see your karma
- **Range**: -100 (Evil) to +100 (Saint)
- **What it represents**: Moral alignment
- **How to gain**: Ethical choices, black market use, civilian casualties
- **Effects**: Blocks certain content, affects faction reactions
