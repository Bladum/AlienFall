---

## New Proposal Ideas

### 9. Diplomatic Cascade System

**Problem Identified**: Countries.md and Relations.md show isolated relationship tracking, but regional politics missing dynamic cascades.

**Gap Details**:
- Country relations exist, but no "ally of my ally" or "enemy of my enemy" logic
- Regional blocs defined but relationships don't ripple through regions
- No trade-off between helping one country vs. upsetting their rival

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Diplomatic Web System:
  - Track country-to-country relationships (not just player-country)
  - Create political blocs with shared enemies
  - Implement cascade mechanics:
    - Help Country A (enemy of Country B) → -10 relation with B
    - Sign alliance with Major Power → +5 with their allies, -15 with rivals
    - War declaration → All allied countries forced to choose sides

Example Scenario:
  Player helps USA (+20 relation)
  Russia is rival of USA (-50 mutual relation)
  Cascade: Russia relation with player -10 (indirect)
  If player reaches +75 with USA (alliance):
    - NATO countries gain +10 (alliance effect)
    - Russia/China bloc lose -20 (opposition effect)

Complexity: Medium
Dev Time: 2 weeks
Impact: Diplomatic strategy becomes multi-dimensional chess
```

### 10. Analytics-Driven Auto-Balance

**Problem Identified**: Analytics.md shows data collection infrastructure, but no auto-balancing feedback loop.

**Gap Details**:
- System collects data (weapon usage, unit survival, mission difficulty)
- No automated response to balance issues discovered
- Manual balance tuning required (designer reviews logs)
- Could leverage AI for automatic adjustment recommendations

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Auto-Balance System:
  Stage 1: Analytics Detection (Existing)
    - Track weapon usage rates (60%+ = overused)
    - Track unit survival rates (>90% = too easy, <40% = too hard)
    - Track mission completion times
  
  Stage 2: Balance Recommendations (NEW)
    - AI analyzes patterns, suggests tweaks:
      - "Rifle accuracy 75% → 70% (overused by 15%)"
      - "Enemy HP 50 → 60 (missions too easy, 85% win rate)"
      - "Sectoid spawn rate 0.3 → 0.25 (overwhelming early game)"
  
  Stage 3: A/B Testing (NEW)
    - Deploy changes to 10% of simulations
    - Compare metrics: usage rates, win rates, satisfaction proxies
    - If improved: Roll out to 100%
    - If worse: Revert, try different adjustment
  
  Stage 4: Player Override (NEW)
    - Player can disable auto-balance (purist mode)
    - View balance change log (transparency)
    - Vote on proposed changes (community input)

Benefits:
  - Continuous balance improvement without patches
  - Data-driven tuning (no designer bias)
  - Rapid iteration cycle (hours not weeks)
  - Emergent balance discovery (AI finds non-obvious patterns)

Complexity: High (AI integration)
Dev Time: 4-6 weeks
Impact: Game stays balanced automatically, perpetual improvement
```

### 11. Country Internal Politics System

**Problem Identified**: Countries.md treats countries as monoliths, but no internal factions or regime changes.

**Gap Details**:
- Country has single "relation" stat
- No political parties or internal conflicts
- No coups, elections, or policy shifts
- Country government type static (no fascism → democracy transitions)

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Internal Politics System:

Government Types (Dynamic):
  - Democracy: Stable, slow relation changes, elections every 4 years
  - Autocracy: Volatile, fast relation changes, coup risk
  - Monarchy: Hereditary, moderate stability, succession crises
  - Military Junta: Aggressive, pro-military spending, short lifespan
  - Theocracy: Ideological, karma-sensitive, missionary events

Political Events:
  "Election in [Country]" (Democracies only):
    - New party elected with different stance on player
    - Pro-Player Party wins: +20 relation
    - Anti-Player Party wins: -30 relation
    - Player can fund campaigns (covert ops, -karma)
  
  "Military Coup in [Country]" (15% chance if panic >70):
    - Government overthrown by military faction
    - Autocracy replaces democracy
    - Player choice: Support coup (pragmatic) or restore democracy (ethical)
  
  "Civil War in [Country]" (10% chance if panic >80 + relation <-50):
    - Country splits into pro-player and anti-player factions
    - Player must choose side or stay neutral
    - Winner determines future relations
  
  "Regime Change via Player" (Covert Op Mission):
    - Unlock at Intelligence 70+, Karma <-30
    - Install puppet government (guarantees +75 relation)
    - High risk: If discovered, -50 relation with ALL countries

Internal Factions (Per Country):
  - Militarists: Favor aggressive defense spending (+funding)
  - Pacifists: Oppose military solutions (-funding, +karma if helped)
  - Industrialists: Pro-economy, anti-disruption (stable funding)
  - Populists: Volatile, react strongly to player actions (±30 swings)
  - Scientists: Pro-research collaboration (+research speed if allied)

Faction Influence:
  Each faction has 0-100% influence in country
  Dominant faction (>60% influence) determines policy
  Elections/coups shift faction balance
  Player actions favor specific factions:
    - Successful missions → +Militarists
    - Minimize casualties → +Pacifists
    - Research sharing → +Scientists
    - Economic growth → +Industrialists

Complexity: High
Dev Time: 3-4 weeks
Impact: Countries feel alive, dynamic political landscape
Priority: MEDIUM (adds depth but not critical)
```

### 12. Morale & Psychology System Enhancement

**Problem Identified**: Units.md mentions morale briefly, but lacks deep psychological warfare mechanics.

**Gap Details**:
- Morale exists but oversimplified (0-100 scale, binary panic)
- No PTSD, shell shock, or long-term trauma
- No psychological warfare tactics (intimidation, propaganda)
- No unit bonds or death impact on squad morale

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Advanced Psychology System:

Unit Mental States:
  Normal (morale 70-100):
    - No penalties
    - Full combat effectiveness
  
  Shaken (morale 40-69):
    - -10% accuracy
    - -1 AP
    - 15% chance to hesitate (skip turn)
  
  Panicked (morale 0-39):
    - -30% accuracy
    - -2 AP
    - 40% chance to flee or fire randomly
  
  Broken (morale <0, cumulative trauma):
    - Cannot be deployed (PTSD)
    - Requires 3 months recovery + therapy
    - May retire permanently (10% chance)

Trauma System:
  Track traumatic events per unit:
    - Squadmate death: -15 morale (permanent trauma point)
    - Near-death experience (<10% HP): -10 morale
    - Witness atrocity (civilian massacre): -20 morale, +1 trauma
    - Captured by aliens: -30 morale, +3 trauma
  
  Trauma Points (Cumulative):
    0-2: Minor issues (occasional flashbacks, -5% combat)
    3-5: PTSD symptoms (therapy required, -15% combat)
    6-9: Severe PTSD (cannot deploy, recovery uncertain)
    10+: Permanent retirement (cannot recover)

Psychological Warfare:
  Player Tactics:
    - "Propaganda Broadcast" (reduces enemy morale -20)
    - "Terror Tactics" (execute prisoners publicly, enemies flee easier)
    - "Demoralizing Victory" (display destroyed enemy equipment)
  
  Enemy Tactics:
    - Alien screech (all units -10 morale, 3 hex radius)
    - Mind control display (seeing ally controlled, -15 morale)
    - Overwhelming force (outnumbered 3:1, -20 morale)

Unit Bonding:
  Track relationships between units:
    - Fight together 10+ missions: "Battle Brothers" (+10 morale when together)
    - Save each other's lives: "Lifelong Debt" (+20 morale, loyalty bond)
    - Shared trauma: "PTSD Support Group" (mutual therapy, faster recovery)
  
  When bonded unit dies:
    - Survivor takes severe morale hit (-30)
    - May seek revenge (aggressive behavior, +30% damage vs. killer)
    - May break down (refuse to deploy for 1 month)

Recovery Systems:
  Therapy Facility (2×2):
    - Cost: 100K
    - Effect: Units recover +10 morale per week
    - Treats trauma (remove 1 trauma point per month)
    - Prevents retirements (90% recovery rate)
  
  R&R (Rest & Recuperation):
    - Units at base gain +5 morale per week passively
    - Can force R&R (remove from active roster, guarantee recovery)
    - Cost: Lost combat availability
  
  Counselor Advisor:
    - Passive: All units +2 morale per week
    - Active: Can therapy session (emergency +20 morale, once per month per unit)

Complexity: Medium-High
Dev Time: 2-3 weeks
Impact: Combat feels personal, units develop histories, loss is meaningful
Priority: MEDIUM (nice depth, not essential)
```

### 13. Salvage & Crafting Economy

**Problem Identified**: Items.md and Economy.md focus on purchase/manufacturing, but salvage system underutilized.

**Gap Details**:
- Salvage collected from missions but just sold for credits
- No crafting from salvaged parts
- No unique "alien hybrid" equipment (mix human + alien tech)
- Manufacturing always uses raw materials, not salvage directly

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Salvage Crafting System:

Salvage Types:
  Common (60% drop rate):
    - Alien Alloy Fragments
    - Weapon Parts
    - Power Cells
    - Electronics
  
  Uncommon (30% drop rate):
    - Intact Alien Weapons
    - Armor Plates
    - Advanced Tech Components
  
  Rare (9% drop rate):
    - Alien Cores (power source)
    - Psionic Crystals
    - Dimensional Shards
  
  Legendary (1% drop rate):
    - UFO Reactor
    - Alien AI Core
    - Reality Anchor Fragment

Crafting Recipes:
  Hybrid Weapons (Combine Human + Alien Tech):
    - Gauss Rifle + Alien Alloy = Alloy Gauss Rifle (+5 damage, lightweight)
    - Plasma Pistol + Human Electronics = Plasma Sidearm (infinite ammo)
    - Rocket Launcher + Alien Core = Plasma Rocket (+50% damage, no ammo)
  
  Unique Equipment (Rare Salvage Required):
    - Psionic Amplifier: 3× Psionic Crystals + Electronics
    - Dimensional Teleporter: 5× Dimensional Shards + UFO Reactor
    - Alien Symbiote Armor: 10× Alien Cores + Armor Plates
  
  Craft Upgrades (Salvage-Based):
    - UFO Thruster (increase craft speed +2)
    - Alien Shields (add energy shields to craft, 50 HP)
    - Stealth Generator (stealth mode, 50% detection reduction)

Salvage Workshop (New Facility 2×2):
  Cost: 75K
  Function: Disassemble salvage into components
  Benefit: 3× salvage → 1× component (crafting material)
  Example: 9× Alien Alloy Fragments → 3× Alloy Ingots → Craft alloy rifle

Salvage Market:
  - Sell excess salvage for credits (50% of base value)
  - Trade salvage with other organizations (barter economy)
  - Black market pays premium for rare salvage (+100% price, -karma)

Strategic Depth:
  - Salvage hoarders can craft unique gear (not available in market)
  - Selling salvage = quick credits, crafting = long-term power
  - Rare salvage enables endgame equipment (progression gate)

Complexity: Medium
Dev Time: 2-3 weeks
Impact: Salvage becomes strategic resource, crafting mini-game
Priority: MEDIUM (adds economic depth)
```

### 14. Dynamic Difficulty Adaptation (Per-Player)

**Problem Identified**: Battlescape.md has fixed difficulty tiers, but no per-player adaptive difficulty.

**Gap Details**:
- Difficulty set at campaign start (Easy/Normal/Hard/Impossible)
- Cannot change mid-campaign
- No dynamic adjustment based on player skill
- Some players find Normal too easy, others find it too hard

**Proposed Solution**:
```yaml
Adaptive Difficulty System:

Performance Tracking:
  Track last 10 missions:
    - Win rate (% successful missions)
    - Average unit casualties per mission
    - Average mission completion time
    - Close calls (missions won with <20% squad HP)

Dynamic Adjustment:
  If win rate >80% (player too strong):
    - Increase enemy count by +20%
    - Increase enemy HP by +15%
    - Unlock elite enemy variants earlier
    - Reduce warning time for threats
  
  If win rate <40% (player struggling):
    - Decrease enemy count by -20%
    - Decrease enemy HP by -15%
    - Increase XP gain by +30% (catchup)
    - Offer "Emergency Aid" (free equipment drop)
  
  If win rate 40-80% (sweet spot):
    - No adjustments (perfect balance)
    - Maintain current difficulty curve

Difficulty Momentum:
  - Changes apply gradually (5% per mission)
  - Prevents sudden difficulty spikes
  - Player can override (lock difficulty if preferred)

Transparency Options:
  "Adaptive Difficulty" setting:
    - ON: Automatic adjustments (default)
    - OFF: Fixed difficulty (purist mode)
    - VISIBLE: Show adjustments in UI (full transparency)

Difficulty Feedback UI:
  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║     ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY STATUS          ║
  ╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
  ║  Win Rate (last 10): 75% ✓              ║
  ║  Current Adjustment: Baseline (0%)      ║
  ║  Trend: Stable                           ║
  ║                                          ║
  ║  Next Mission Difficulty: STANDARD      ║
  ║  Enemy Count: 12 (unchanged)            ║
  ║  Enemy Strength: 100% (unchanged)       ║
  ║                                          ║
  ║  [Lock Difficulty] [View History]       ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝

Complexity: Medium
Dev Time: 1-2 weeks
Impact: Game stays challenging for all skill levels, reduces frustration
Priority: HIGH (accessibility improvement)
