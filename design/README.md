# Game Design

## Goal / Purpose

The Design folder contains all game design documentation, including detailed system mechanics, design decisions, balance parameters, and comprehensive gap analysis of what has been designed versus what remains to be implemented.

## Content

- **DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for creating new design documents
- **GLOSSARY.md** - Comprehensive glossary of game terms and concepts
- **gaps/** - Analysis of design-to-implementation gaps
- **mechanics/** - Detailed design specifications for each game system

## Features

- **Comprehensive Design Specifications**: Detailed mechanics for every game system
- **Balance Parameters**: Numbers, costs, and difficulty settings
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies what's designed but not yet implemented
- **Visual Documentation**: Diagrams and examples of systems
- **Design Rationale**: Why certain decisions were made
- **Glossary**: Consistent terminology across project
- **Design Templates**: Standardized format for new designs

## Integrations with Other Systems

### Architecture
- Architecture in `architecture/` implements these designs
- Integration flows show how designed systems connect
- Roadmap prioritizes design implementation

### API Documentation
- API files in `api/` formalize these design specifications
- TOML configurations make designs data-driven
- Examples in API show design in practice

### Engine Implementation
- Engine in `engine/` implements these designs
- Code structure mirrors design organization
- Design decisions guide implementation choices

### Testing
- Test cases in `tests/` verify design requirements
- Mock data matches design specifications
- Integration tests validate design interactions

### Lore & Content
- Lore in `lore/` provides context for design decisions
- Design mechanics support narrative progression
- Story phases guide feature implementation sequence

## Design Structure

### Mechanics Folder
Contains detailed system designs:
- **Units.md** - Unit classes, abilities, progression
- **Battlescape.md** - Tactical combat mechanics
- **Geoscape.md** - Strategic layer and world management
- **Basescape.md** - Base construction and management
- **Economy.md** - Financial systems and resources
- **AI_Systems.md** - AI decision-making
- And more for each major system...

### Gaps Folder
Documents design-to-implementation gaps:
- **GAPS_SUMMARY.md** - High-level overview of gaps
- **API_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md** - Which systems need API work
- **API_ENHANCEMENT_STATUS.md** - Current API completeness
- Individual gap files for each system
