1. Premise and Scope
- Logline: Humanity wages a multi-front war against hidden terrestrial conspiracies, ancient deep‑sea horrors, and a culminating dimensional invasion. Lead a clandestine organization that grows from a private firm into a unified global defense project. Choices carry permanent consequences.
- Scope: Narrative-only. Use tags and hooks to connect with spawners, research unlocks, and campaign milestones defined in `rules.md`.

2. Campaign Structure and Phases (Narrative)
- Phase 0 — Shadow War (1996–1999): Human factions, covert operations, and supernatural outbreaks. Evidence suppression intensifies as subtle alien signs appear.
- Phase 1 — Sky War (1999–2001): First Contact leads to open conflict. Terrestrial alien forces escalate; psionics is revealed.
- Phase 2 — Deep War / Land War (2001–2002): A second front opens under the oceans. Aquatic species and USOs threaten coasts; politics fragment after major victories.
- Phase 3 — Dimensional War / Global War (2003–2004): Regional human superpowers rise. Dimensional breaches and psionic, reality‑warping enemies culminate in a Nexus assault.
