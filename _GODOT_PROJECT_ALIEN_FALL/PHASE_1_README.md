# AlienFall Godot Implementation - Phase 1

## Overview

Phase 1 implements the core infrastructure and basic UI framework for AlienFall in Godot 4.4. This phase establishes the foundational systems that will support the full game implementation.

## What's Implemented

### Core Systems (Autoloads)

1. **EventBus** (`scripts/autoloads/event_bus.gd`)
   - Global event system for loose coupling between game systems
   - Supports publish/subscribe pattern
   - Includes event filtering and callback management

2. **RNGService** (`scripts/autoloads/rng_service.gd`)
   - Deterministic random number generation with seed tracking
   - Supports seeded RNG handles for different game contexts
   - Includes provenance logging for debugging and replay

3. **DataRegistry** (`scripts/autoloads/data_registry.gd`)
   - Central repository for all game data
   - Loads JSON/YAML data files automatically
   - Supports data querying and filtering

4. **GameState** (`scripts/autoloads/game_state.gd`)
   - Global game state management
   - Campaign data, player progress, and settings
   - Game mode transitions and statistics tracking

### Domain Classes

1. **Unit** (`scripts/domain/unit.gd`)
   - Represents soldiers, aliens, and other actors
   - Stats, inventory, traits, and abilities
   - Combat and progression mechanics

2. **Item** (`scripts/domain/item.gd`)
   - Weapons, armor, and equipment
   - Damage calculations and weapon modes
   - Manufacturing and research requirements

3. **Facility** (`scripts/domain/facility.gd`)
   - Base buildings and installations
   - Capacities, services, and operational requirements
   - Construction and maintenance costs

### User Interface

1. **Main Menu** (`scenes/main_menu.tscn` + `scripts/states/main_menu_state.gd`)
   - Game title and menu options
   - New Game, Load Game, Options, Quit buttons
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+L, etc.)

2. **Geoscape** (`scenes/geoscape.tscn` + `scripts/states/geoscape_state.gd`)
   - Strategic world map view
   - Time controls (pause/play/fast-forward)
   - Basic UI for base management, research, and manufacturing
   - Funding and mission tracking display

3. **Test Scene** (`scenes/test_scene.tscn` + `tests/unit_tests/test_core_systems.gd`)
   - Automated testing of core systems
   - Console output verification
   - Accessible from main menu

### Sample Data

- **Units**: Sample alien and human units with stats and abilities
- **Items**: Weapons, armor, and utility items with properties
- **Facilities**: Base buildings with capacities and requirements

## How to Use

1. **Start the Game**: Run the project from Godot Editor or export
2. **Main Menu**: Choose New Game to start a campaign
3. **Geoscape**: View the strategic map and manage your operations
4. **Run Tests**: Use the "RUN TESTS" button to verify core systems

## Key Features

- **Deterministic Gameplay**: All random events are seeded and reproducible
- **Data-Driven Design**: Game content loaded from external JSON files
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling between game systems
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Basic UI Framework**: Functional interface without complex graphics

## Technical Notes

- **Godot 4.4**: Uses modern Godot features and syntax
- **GDScript**: All logic implemented in GDScript for performance
- **Scene-Based UI**: Clean separation between UI and game logic
- **Autoload Pattern**: Global services accessible throughout the game
- **Resource Classes**: Custom resource types for game objects

## Testing

Run the test scene to verify:
- Event system functionality
- RNG determinism and provenance
- Data loading and querying
- Game state management
- Domain object creation and manipulation

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Phase 2 will focus on:
- Enhanced Geoscape with world map rendering
- Base management system
- Research and manufacturing queues
- Mission generation and tracking
- Improved UI with better visual design

## File Structure

```

This foundation provides a solid base for building the complete AlienFall game in Godot.
