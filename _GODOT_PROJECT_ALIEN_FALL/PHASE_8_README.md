# Phase 8: Economy System Integration

## Overview

Phase 8 implements the economy system with purchases, transfers, and invoices integration. The system provides deterministic marketplace operations, transfer logistics, and event-driven progression through TimeService integration.

## Components

### PurchaseSystem (Main Interface)
- **Location**: `scripts/economy/purchase_system.gd`
- **Purpose**: Main interface for economy operations
- **Features**:
  - Marketplace purchase processing
  - Transfer creation and management
  - Item selling functionality
  - Prerequisite and stock validation

### PurchaseManager
- **Location**: `scripts/economy/purchase_manager.gd`
- **Purpose**: Manages purchase orders and delivery scheduling
- **Features**:
  - Order placement and tracking
  - Daily delivery progression
  - Monthly restocking
  - Event publishing for order lifecycle

### TransferManager
- **Location**: `scripts/economy/transfer_manager.gd`
- **Purpose**: Handles transfers between bases
- **Features**:
  - Transfer creation and validation
  - Cost and time calculation
  - Capacity validation
  - Delivery tracking

### Supporting Classes
- **PurchaseOrder**: `scripts/economy/purchase_order.gd` - Individual purchase order representation
- **Transfer**: `scripts/economy/transfer.gd` - Transfer between bases representation

## Key Features

### Deterministic Behavior
- Same seed produces identical purchase/transfer results
- Time-based progression through TimeService integration
- Predictable delivery schedules and costs

### Event-Driven Architecture
- `purchase_order_placed` - When order is created
- `purchase_order_delivered` - When order completes
- `transfer_created` - When transfer is initiated
- `transfer_delivered` - When transfer completes
- `monthly_restock` - Monthly marketplace restocking

### Marketplace Mechanics
- **Prerequisites**: Research requirements, regional restrictions
- **Stock Limits**: Monthly stock with automatic restocking
- **Cost Validation**: Funding checks before purchase
- **Delivery Time**: Configurable delivery schedules

### Transfer System
- **Cost Calculation**: Distance-based with payload factors
- **Transit Time**: Province-distance driven
- **Capacity Validation**: Transport size/volume limits
- **Priority System**: Transfer prioritization

## Usage Examples

### Making a Purchase
```gdscript
# Load marketplace data
var marketplace_data = {
    "alloy": {
        "price": 200,
        "delivery_time": 7,
        "monthly_stock": 50
    }
}
PurchaseSystem.load_marketplace_data(marketplace_data)

# Make purchase
var success = PurchaseSystem.make_purchase("base_1", "alloy", 10)
```

### Creating a Transfer
```gdscript
var payload = [
    {"type": "item", "id": "alloy", "quantity": 10, "volume": 5}
]
var transfer = PurchaseSystem.create_transfer("base_a", "base_b", payload)
```

### Getting Available Items
```gdscript
var available_items = PurchaseSystem.get_available_entries("base_1")
for item in available_items:
    print(item.id + ": $" + str(item.price))
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run economy tests
run_economy_tests.bat

# Or directly with Godot
godot --path . --scene scenes/economy_test_scene.tscn
```

### Test Coverage
- **Purchase Lifecycle**: Order placement to delivery
- **Transfer Operations**: Creation, progression, delivery
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Same seed = same results
- **Stock Limits**: Monthly stock enforcement
- **Event Publishing**: Proper event emission verification

## Integration Points

### TimeService
- Daily ticks progress deliveries
- Monthly ticks trigger restocking
- Deterministic time advancement for testing

### GameState
- Funding management for purchases
- Research completion tracking
- Campaign state integration

### EventBus
- Global event publishing for UI updates
- Cross-system communication
- Telemetry and logging integration

### RNGService
- Deterministic random number generation
- Seeded operations for reproducibility
- Context-specific random streams

## Configuration

### Marketplace Data Format
```gdscript
{
    "item_id": {
        "price": 100,
        "delivery_time": 7,
        "monthly_stock": 50,
        "prerequisites": {
            "research": ["research_id"],
            "regions": ["north_america"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Transfer Configuration
- **Distance Multiplier**: Provinces to cost/time conversion
- **Capacity Factors**: Unit size and volume calculations
- **Cost Factors**: Base costs and payload multipliers

## Future Extensions

### Planned Features
- **Invoice Generation**: Monthly billing system
- **Black Market**: Risk-reward trading system
- **Manufacturing**: Production queue management
- **Supply Chains**: Multi-step transfer chains

### UI Integration
- Marketplace browser interface
- Transfer queue management
- Invoice display system
- Economic reports and analytics

## Quality Gates

âœ… **Completed**:
- Purchase order lifecycle with events
- Transfer creation and delivery
- Deterministic behavior verification
- Event publishing integration
- TimeService daily/monthly progression
- Comprehensive test suite

ðŸ”„ **Validated**:
- Same seed produces identical results
- Events properly published and consumed
- Time-based progression works correctly
- Stock limits and prerequisites enforced
