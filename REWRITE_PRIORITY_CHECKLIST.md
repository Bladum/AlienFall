3. **Identify formulas** - Mathematical specifications
4. **Note integration points** - Cross-system dependencies
5. **Collect examples** - Numeric scenarios
6. **Structure with ToC** - Match wiki organization depth
7. **Add Love2D notes** - Implementation specifics
8. **Include TOML examples** - Data structure samples
9. **Add Mermaid diagrams** - Visual workflows (where appropriate)

## Success Metrics

### Target Completion Metrics
- **Average file length:** 80+ lines (currently 30-50)
- **Documentation depth score:** 8/10+ (currently 2/10)
- **Integration coverage:** 100% of systems (currently ~10%)
- **Formula inclusion:** 80%+ of mechanical systems (currently ~20%)
- **Example quality:** Numeric calculations (currently generic)
- **TOML coverage:** All configurable systems (currently 0%)

### Final Assessment Criteria
- âœ… Can a developer implement any system from docs alone?
- âœ… Are all cross-system interactions documented?
- âœ… Are formulas complete and unambiguous?
- âœ… Are examples realistic and calculated?
- âœ… Can modders extend systems using templates?
- âœ… Is the architecture clear and Love2D-specific?
