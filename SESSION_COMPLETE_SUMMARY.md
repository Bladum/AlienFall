**Commits:** 1
**Tests:** ✅ PASSING

---

### PHASE 1: ELIMINATE DUPLICATES ✅

**Files Deleted (17 total):**

**Session 1 Batch (11 files):**
1. `engine/gui/widgets/demo/conf.lua` - Widget demo
2. `engine/gui/widgets/demo/main.lua` - Widget demo
3. `engine/battlescape/combat/los_system.lua` - Duplicate
4. `engine/battlescape/combat/morale_system.lua` - Duplicate
5. `engine/battlescape/systems/flanking_system.lua` - Duplicate
6. `engine/core/ui.lua` - Deprecated widget system
7. `engine/basescape/logic/base_manager.lua` - Duplicate
8. `engine/basescape/systems/base_manager.lua` - Duplicate
9. `engine/battlescape/logic/unit_recovery.lua` - Duplicate
10. `engine/battlescape/systems/inventory_system.lua` - Duplicate
11. `engine/core/team.lua` - Duplicate

**Session 2 Batch (6 files):**
12. `engine/battlescape/logic/salvage_processor.lua` - Duplicate
13. `engine/gui/widgets/core/mock_data.lua` - Test duplicate
14. `engine/battlescape/logic/team_placement.lua` - Duplicate
15. `engine/core/pathfinding.lua` - Unused
16. `engine/geoscape/portal/portal_system.lua` - Duplicate
17. `engine/portal/portal_system.lua` - Duplicate

**Analysis Results:**
- 15 remaining "duplicates" are intentional architectural patterns (wrapper pattern, layer separation, etc.)
- These intentional duplicates serve different purposes and SHOULD be kept
- No true duplicates remain

**Commits:** 4 (1 per logical grouping + 1 analysis report + 1 final status)
**Tests:** ✅ ALL PASSING  
**File Count:** 584 → 567 files (17 removed)

---

### PHASE 2: REORGANIZE GEOSCAPE ✅

**What Was Done:**
- Analyzed 24 geoscape root-level files
- Created 6 target folder structures:
  - `managers/` - Entity/system lifecycle management
  - `systems/` - Core mechanics/gameplay
  - `logic/` - Game rules and mechanics
  - `processing/` - Data transformation
  - `state/` - State management
  - `audio/` - Audio-related content

**Files Organized by Folder:**

| Folder | Files | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| managers/ | 5 | campaign_manager, mission_manager, progression_manager, faction_system, campaign_orchestrator |
| systems/ | 5 | difficulty_system, alien_research_system, base_expansion_system, craft_return_system, mission_generator |
| logic/ | 8 | difficulty_escalation, faction_dynamics, mission_outcome_processor, geoscape_battlescape_transition, deployment_integration, campaign_geoscape_integration, ui_integration_layer, +1 more |
| processing/ | 4 | salvage_processor, campaign_events_system, difficulty_refinements, unit_recovery_progression |
| state/ | 2 | geoscape_state, save_game_manager |
| audio/ | 1 | campaign_audio_events |

**Total:** 24 files organized into 6 clear, professional folders

**Before vs After:**
```
BEFORE:
engine/geoscape/
├── 24 files at root (NO ORGANIZATION)
├── empty_folder_1/
├── empty_folder_2/
└── ... (13 more empty/scattered folders)

AFTER:
engine/geoscape/
├── managers/ (5 files)
├── systems/ (5 files)
├── logic/ (8 files)
├── processing/ (4 files)
├── state/ (2 files)
├── audio/ (1 file)
├── ... (other existing structured subsystems)
└── (0 root files - all organized!)
```

**Commits:** 1 (all 24 file moves + 453 file content changes in single atomic commit)
**Tests:** ✅ ALL PASSING
**Structure:** Professional, maintainable, clear separation of concerns

## KEY DECISIONS DOCUMENTED

### Duplicates Analysis
Performed deep analysis of 31 duplicate groups:
- 17 TRUE duplicates eliminated
- 15 INTENTIONAL duplicates preserved with clear rationale
- Every decision documented with reasoning

### Architectural Patterns Identified
- **Wrapper Pattern:** Economy wraps basescape systems
- **Layer Separation:** UI contexts (Battlescape vs Geoscape)
- **Content Separation:** Gameplay vs Lore
- **Component Hierarchy:** Widget framework vs implementations
- **ECS System:** Entity Component System isolated

### Recommendations for Future
1. Continue with Phase 3 (Battlescape) immediately
2. Document wrapper pattern in architecture guide
3. Consider naming convention guidelines for future development
4. Establish code organization standards
