## Overview


AlienFall systems are interconnected. Strategic choices on Geoscape impact Basescape construction, which determines Battlescape unit composition, which generates salvage funding research, which unlocks technologies feeding back to Geoscape. All systems affect all other systems through explicit data flows.

### Design Principle

Three types of flows connect systems:
- Upward Flow: Tactical outcomes (mission success) generate resources for strategic layers
- Downward Flow: Strategic decisions (research priority) determine tactical capabilities  
- Lateral Flow: Parallel systems interact through shared resources and constraints

## System Architecture

### Four Tier Hierarchy

| Tier | Layer | Timescale | Scope |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Geoscape | Monthly | Global strategy, missions, diplomacy |
| 2 | Interception | Per-encounter | Craft vs UFO combat |
| 3 | Battlescape | Per-mission | Tactical squad combat |
| 4 | Unit System | Long-term | Individual soldier progression |

## The Three Layers

### Geoscape (Strategic)

**Timescale**: Monthly cycles affecting campaign for weeks/months

**Receives**: Unit availability, crafts ready, research completions, country funding, threat level

**Decides**: Mission acceptance, craft deployment, base expansion, resource allocation, diplomatic stance

**Produces**: UFO encounters, mission definitions, strategic context, diplomatic events

**Example**: Player gathers scouts, deploys craft to UFO crash, wins interception, generates Battlescape mission, captures salvage enabling research, Geoscape gains new capability

### Basescape (Operational/Economic)

**Timescale**: Daily decisions; facility construction takes weeks

**Receives**: Mission salvage, research direction, monthly funding, organizational reputation

**Decides**: Research priority, manufacturing queue, facility construction, unit recruitment, resource trading

**Produces**: Equipped units, ready crafts, manufactured items, fame/karma shifts

**Example**: Salvage processed to research "Advanced Armor" (3 weeks, 5 scientists), manufacturing unlocks, units equipped, next mission success rate improves 60% to 75%

### Battlescape (Tactical)

**Timescale**: Single mission; 6-10 turns

**Receives**: Unit stats, equipment, team composition, mission objective

**Decides**: Unit movement, targeting, ability usage, formations

**Produces**: Casualties, experience, salvage, mission results

**Example**: Squad equipped with Plasma weapons defeats aliens, captured alien armor generates new research option, Basescape unlocks "Alien Technology Analysis"

## Core Integration Loops

### Loop 1: Equipment Progression Spiral (4-6 weeks)

Victory -> Salvage -> Research Unlocks -> Manufacturing -> Better Equipment -> Higher Success Rate -> More Salvage

**Timeline**: Week 1 salvage Plasma weapon, Week 2-3 research complete, Week 4-5 manufacture and deploy, Week 6 mission success rate improves, Week 7 cycle repeats

**Consequence**: Early research choices compound into mid-game advantage

### Loop 2: Unit Attachment (2-4 months)

Rookie (0 XP) -> 5 missions -> Experienced (Rank 1) -> 15 more missions -> Veteran (Rank 2, +20% accuracy) -> Valuable Asset -> Player Protects Unit

**Timeline**: ~2 months per rank advance, losing Veteran = 45+ missions to replace

**Consequence**: Player develops emotional investment, casualty feels catastrophic

### Loop 3: Economic Pressure (Monthly)

Mission Success -> Funding Increase -> More Operations -> More Missions -> Higher Income

Mission Failure -> Funding Decrease -> Fewer Operations -> Fewer Missions -> Lower Income -> Deficit Spending

**Consequence**: Two failed months create crisis; recovery needs 3-4 successful months

### Loop 4: Tech Tree Bottleneck (6-12 weeks)

Tier 1 (20 man-days) -> Tier 2 (50 man-days, needs components) -> Tier 3 (100+ man-days, needs rare aliens)

**Consequence**: Early specialization creates divergent playstyles with different late-game strengths

## Economic Cascades

Resources flow: Mission Outcomes -> Basescape Processing -> Geoscape Utilization -> Next Mission

**Mission Generates**: Salvage equipment/materials, aliens for research, credits, unit experience

**Basescape Converts**: Research progress, manufacturing capability, unit advancement, facility improvements

**Geoscape Applies**: Craft deployment, unit deployment, territory control, strategic positioning

**Feedback**: Each layer depends on prior layer output, creating interconnected resource web

## Political Integration

### Fame & Funding Loop

Mission Success (+5 Fame) -> Monthly Scoring (+20 points) -> Country Relationship (+1) -> Funding Level Increase (+5-10% credits) -> More Operations -> Higher Success Rate

**Consequence**: Early success enables exponential late-game funding growth

### Karma Branching

Prisoner Execution -> -20 Karma -> Unlock Black Market missions -> Block Humanitarian missions

Prisoner Release -> +10 Karma -> Unlock Humanitarian missions -> Block Black Market

**Consequence**: Early tactical choices lock endgame content availability

## Unit Progression

### Experience Formula

(5 XP per turn) + (10 XP per kill) + (2 XP per objective) + (1 XP per turn survived)

Example: 8-turn mission, 2 kills, 1 objective = (40) + (20) + (2) + (8) = 70 XP

### Rank Bonuses

- Experienced (100 XP): +10% accuracy, +5% defense
- Veteran (300 XP): +20% accuracy, +10% defense, +1 AP
- Expert (600 XP): +30% accuracy, +15% defense
- Master (1000 XP): +40% accuracy, +20% defense, special ability
- Elite (1500 XP): +50% accuracy, +25% defense, unique ability
- Hero (2100 XP): +60% accuracy, +30% defense, heroic action

**Consequence**: Elite casualty = 4+ months investment lost, 45+ mission recovery period

## Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: Research Breakthrough Cascade

Research "Plasma Technology" completes -> Manufacturing unlocked -> 4 units manufactured (1 week) -> Squad reequipped -> Next mission 65% -> 75% success -> Plasma damage bonus vs armor -> Victory -> Salvage increases -> New research "Alien Weapon Analysis" available -> Geoscape capability expands -> Country relations improve

**Effect**: One research unlock triggers 6+ weeks of downstream changes

### Example 2: Veteran Casualty

Veteran Sniper dies -> Fame -3 -> Hire Rookie Sniper -> Squad power 100% -> 70% -> Next mission 75% -> 55% success rate -> Recovery period 45+ missions

**Effect**: Single casualty creates extended weakness period, potential cascade into crisis

### Example 3: Economic Crisis

Month 1: 1 success, 1 failure = Funding Level 5 -> 4

Month 2: 0 success, 2 failures = Funding Level 4 -> 3

Month 3: Low budget forces craft grounding = 1 fewer mission slot

Month 4: Income falls below expenses = Deficit spending

Month 5+: Forced to sell equipment = Capability loss = Higher failure rate

**Recovery**: Requires 3-4 consecutive successful months

## Emergent Complexity

### Multi-System Decision Consequences

Accept UFO Interception -> Craft deployed -> Combat occurs -> Craft damaged -> Repair queued -> Maintenance costs increase -> Facility slot blocked 3-7 days -> Operations delayed -> Fewer missions available -> Income opportunity lost -> Funding pressure increases

Single decision ripples through all systems.

### Feedback Types

1. **Positive Feedback**: Success -> Funding -> Operations -> Salvage -> Research -> Equipment -> Success
2. **Negative Feedback**: Failure -> Casualties -> Morale -> Loss -> Crisis -> Harder Missions -> Failure
3. **Delayed Feedback**: Research (Week 1) -> Manufacturing (Week 3) -> Deployment (Week 5) -> Mission (Week 6) -> Consequences (Week 10)
4. **Competing Feedback**: Unit death increases caution (negative) but reduces maintenance (positive)

## Key Takeaways

1. No Isolated Decisions: Every choice triggers cascades across systems
2. Timing Matters: Early decisions compound; Month 1 research affects Month 6 capabilities
3. Resource Scarcity: Limited scientists, credits, and craft slots force meaningful prioritization
4. Long-Term Investment: Units and bases are persistent; casualties create lasting impact
5. Feedback Spirals: Success enables more success; failure creates traps requiring recovery
6. Emergent Difficulty: AI adapts to player progression, creating dynamic challenge scaling
