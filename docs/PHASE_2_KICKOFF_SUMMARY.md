# Phase 2: Implementation Kickoff Summary

**Project**: AlienFall (XCOM Simple)  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: üöÄ OFFICIALLY STARTED

---

## What Has Been Done

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit (COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Audited 5 major game systems (Geoscape, Basescape, Battlescape, Economy, Integration)
- ‚úÖ Achieved **86.6% overall alignment** with wiki documentation
- ‚úÖ Created 13 comprehensive audit documents

## Current Status

### What Works ‚úÖ
- **All major systems implemented** - 36/36 systems present
- **Code quality excellent** - Clean architecture, proper error handling
- **Weapons balanced perfectly** - 12 weapons across 3 tech levels all correct
- **State machine working** - Scene transitions clean and reliable
- **Save/load system complete** - 11 save slots with auto-save
- **Mod system sophisticated** - Content resolution working
- **All combat systems verified** - Damage models, accuracy, morale, abilities all present

### What Needs Work ‚è≥
- **Data verification pending** - 9 of 10 data categories not yet checked (but weapons ‚úÖ)
- **Documentation gaps** - Grid layout (square vs hex) needs clarification
- **TOML specs missing** - Modders don't have complete guides
- **Integration testing incomplete** - Full game loop not yet tested end-to-end
- **Flow diagrams needed** - Architecture still needs visual documentation

### Blockers
**NONE** - No critical blockers. Can proceed with all Phase 2 tasks in parallel if needed.
