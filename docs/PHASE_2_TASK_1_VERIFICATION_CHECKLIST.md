## Verification Process

### For Each Data File:

1. **Read TOML file**
   ```
   cat mods/core/rules/items/weapons.toml
   ```

2. **Cross-reference wiki documentation**
   - Check wiki/systems/Economy.md for expected values
   - Check wiki/systems/Battlescape.md for combat balance
   - Check wiki/FAQ.md for game mechanics

3. **Verify Against Code**
   - Look up how values are used in Lua code
   - Check damage calculations
   - Check cost calculations
   - Check modifiers application

4. **Document Findings**
   - ‚úÖ MATCHES: Value matches documentation and code
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è DIFFERS: Value differs, but is reasonable
   - ‚ùå WRONG: Value causes issues (too high/low)
   - üìã MISSING: Value not documented

5. **Adjust If Needed**
   - Update TOML file if incorrect
   - Document reason for change
   - Re-verify calculations
