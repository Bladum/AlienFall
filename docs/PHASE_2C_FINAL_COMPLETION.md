## Detailed Implementation

### Phase 2C.1: Strategic Planning ✅

**File:** `engine/ai/strategic_planner.lua` (346 lines)

**Components Implemented:**

**Mission Scoring System (0-100 scale):**
- **Factor 1: Reward Value (40% weight, 0-40 points)**
  - Higher reward increases score linearly
  - Capped at 40 points for 10,000+ credit reward
  
- **Factor 2: Risk Assessment (30% weight, 0-30 points)**
  - Difficulty vs player tech level
  - High risk (difficulty > tech+1): multiplier 0.5
  - Easy (difficulty ≤ tech-2): multiplier 1.2 (morale bonus)
  - Risk-adjusted score: (30 - difficulty*3) * multiplier
  
- **Factor 3: Relations Impact (20% weight, 0-20 points)**
  - Faction missions: 20 points
  - Neutral: 10 points
  
- **Factor 4: Strategic Value (10% weight, 0-10 points)**
  - Tech unlocks: 10 points
  - Region opening: 7 points
  - Influence gain: 5 points
  - Standard: 0 points

**Time Pressure Multiplier:**
- < 3 turns to deadline: ×1.3
- < 6 turns to deadline: ×1.15
- Otherwise: ×1.0

**Recommendation Tiers:**
- ≥75: ★★★ CRITICAL - Accept immediately
