## Detailed Implementation

### Phase 2B Step 1: Personnel Cost Breakdown ✅

**File:** `engine/economy/finance/personnel_system.lua` (215 lines)

**Features Implemented:**

**Role-Based Salaries:**
```lua
BASE_SALARY = {
  soldier = 100,
  scientist = 150,
  engineer = 150,
  commander = 300
}
```

**Experience Multipliers:**
- Level 0 (Rookie): 1.0× → 100-300 credits/month
- Level 1: 1.1× → 110-330 credits/month
- Level 2: 1.2× → 120-360 credits/month
- Level 3+ (Expert): 1.3× → 130-390 credits/month

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateSalary(role, experienceLevel)` - Individual salary calculation
- `calculateTotalPersonnelCosts(base)` - Base total with breakdown
- `handleCasualty(base, unit)` - Casualty processing (500 credit replacement)
- `getDetailedBreakdown(base)` - Personnel counts by level and role
- `getSummary(base)` - UI-friendly summary text

**Integration Points:**
- Feeds into Treasury expense tracking
- FinancialManager registers as expense source
- Supports monthly financial cycle processing

**Example Calculation:**
- Soldiers: 12 × 100-120 = 1,200-1,440/month
- Scientists: 5 × 150-180 = 750-900/month
- Engineers: 3 × 150-180 = 450-540/month
- Commanders: 1 × 300-390 = 300-390/month
- **Total:** ~3,700-3,270/month (varies by experience)

---

### Phase 2B Step 2: Supplier Relationship Pricing ✅

**File:** `engine/economy/finance/supplier_pricing_system.lua` (287 lines)

**Features Implemented:**

**Relations-Based Price Multipliers:**
```lua
Relations Value → Price Multiplier
  < -50 (Hostile):     1.5× (premium pricing)
  -50 to 0 (Unfriendly): Interpolate 1.0-1.5×
  0 to +50 (Friendly):  Interpolate 1.0-0.9×
  > +50 (Allied):       0.8× (bulk discount)
```

**Regional Market Variance:**
- Pseudo-random variation: ±10% (0.9× to 1.1×)
- Seeded by region and game month
- Ensures consistency within month, variation across months

**Black Market Pricing:**
- 2.0× base price (bypass relations multiplier)
- No traceability (hidden from allies)
- Higher risk, higher cost option

**Key Functions:**
- `getRelationsMultiplier(relationsValue)` - Relations → multiplier
- `getRegionalVariance(regionId, seed)` - ±10% market variance
- `calculatePrice(basePrice, supplierId, relations, seed)` - Final price
- `getBlackMarketPrice(basePrice)` - 2.0× black market price
- `getPriceDescription(itemPrice, basePrice)` - UI status text
- `validatePrice()` - Price range validation for testing

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Hostile Relations**
- Base item: 1000 credits
- Relations: -75 (hostile)
- Relations multiplier: 1.5×
- Regional variance: 0.95×
- **Final price: 1000 × 1.5 × 0.95 = 1,425 credits**

**Scenario 2: Allied Relations**
- Base item: 1000 credits
- Relations: +75 (allied)
- Relations multiplier: 0.8×
- Regional variance: 1.05×
- **Final price: 1000 × 0.8 × 1.05 = 840 credits**

**Scenario 3: Black Market**
- Base item: 1000 credits
- Relations: -100 (hostile, no help)
- **Black market price: 1000 × 2.0 = 2,000 credits (2x base)**

**Integration Points:**
- Marketplace pricing uses this system
- FinancialManager requests dynamic prices
- Relations system provides faction ratings
- UI shows price multipliers and reasons

---

### Phase 2B Step 3: Budget Forecasting ✅

**File:** `engine/economy/finance/budget_forecast.lua` (295 lines)

**Features Implemented:**

**Multi-Month Projections:**
- Projects 1-12 months ahead
- Assumes current income/expense rates continue
- Calculates running balance for each month
- Determines status (healthy/tight/warning/deficit)

**What-If Scenarios:**
- `projectWithChange()` simulates impact of decisions
- Supports scenarios:
  - Build facility (one-time cost)
  - Hire unit (recurring salary)
  - Research boost (one-time cost)
  - Base expansion (complex multi-impact)
  - Emergency expense (one-time)
  - Supply run (restocking)

**Status Determination:**
```
Running Balance Status:
  < 0:        DEFICIT (bankrupt)
  0-2000:     WARNING (critical, running out)
  2000-5000:  TIGHT (budget constrained)
  > 5000:     HEALTHY (adequate funds)
```

**Key Functions:**
- `projectMonths(base, monthsAhead)` - Generate N-month forecast
- `projectWithChange(base, change)` - What-if scenario analysis
- `getForecastDescription(projection)` - Status text for UI
- `getStatusColor(status)` - Color coding (green/yellow/red)
- `compareProjections()` - Delta analysis between scenarios
- `formatProjection()` - Display formatting

**Example Forecast (6 months ahead):**
```
Month 1: Income 15000 - Expenses 5000 = +10000 (Running: 110000) [HEALTHY]
Month 2: Income 15000 - Expenses 5000 = +10000 (Running: 120000) [HEALTHY]
Month 3: Income 15000 - Expenses 8000 = +7000  (Running: 127000) [HEALTHY]
Month 4: Income 15000 - Expenses 8000 = +7000  (Running: 134000) [HEALTHY]
Month 5: Income 15000 - Expenses 5000 = +10000 (Running: 144000) [HEALTHY]
Month 6: Income 15000 - Expenses 5000 = +10000 (Running: 154000) [HEALTHY]
```

**What-If Example (Building Facility):**
```
Base Projection: Balance +10000, Running 110000 [HEALTHY]
Build Facility (-75000 cost):
  New Expenses: 5000 + 75000 = 80000
  Month Balance: 15000 - 80000 = -65000
  New Running: 35000 [TIGHT - Risky]
  Status Change: HEALTHY → TIGHT
```

**Integration Points:**
- Displayed in budget planning UI
- Helps players make informed decisions
- Prevents bankruptcy through planning
- Shows impact before commitment
