### 3. Advanced Features ✅
- **Psionic Abilities**: 11+ abilities fully implemented with skill checks
- **Terrain Destruction**: Progressive damage states with material properties
- **Environmental Effects**: Fire, smoke, with proper obstacle handling
- **Equipment System**: Armor and skills properly integrated

### 4. Documentation ✅
- **Code Comments**: Excellent LuaDoc comments in all modules
- **Wiki**: Comprehensive (2000+ lines covering all mechanics)
- **Examples**: Function examples in module headers

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Priority 1: Immediate (Before Gameplay Testing)

#### 1.1: Comprehensive Manual Testing
- Follow `BATTLESCAPE_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
- Test all 11+ psionic abilities in combat
- Verify damage pipeline with various weapon/armor combinations
- Validate morale state transitions
- Check console for any errors during gameplay

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH - Catches bugs before production

#### 1.2: Verify Console Output
- Run with `lovec "engine"` (already configured)
- Confirm all systems logging correctly
- Watch for:
  - Nil reference errors
  - Table access errors
  - Module loading issues
  - Performance warnings

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Ensures debugging visibility

### Priority 2: High (Before Modding Release)

#### 2.1: Create Modding Documentation
- Add code examples to wiki for:
  - Creating custom weapons with damage types
  - Adding new psionic abilities
  - Creating armor with resistance properties
  - Adding status effects

**Files to Update**:
- `wiki/api/Combat.md` (create if needed)
- `wiki/examples/Modding_Combat.md` (create)
- Update `DEVELOPMENT.md` with modding section

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Enables community modding

#### 2.2: Expand Unit Test Coverage
- Add tests for edge cases:
  - Zero damage scenarios
  - Armor penetration edge cases
  - Morale threshold transitions
  - Psionic ability range limits

**Test File**: `tests/battlescape/` (existing structure)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Ensures robustness

### Priority 3: Enhancement (Polish)

#### 3.1: Concealment/Stealth System
- Current: Basic LOS system
- Enhancement: Formal concealment tracking
- Benefits: Enables stealth gameplay mechanics

**Files to Create**:
- `engine/battlescape/combat/concealment_system.lua`
- `engine/battlescape/systems/visibility_tracking.lua`

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Nice-to-have gameplay feature

#### 3.2: Difficulty Scaling Verification
- Wiki documents squad size scaling
- Implementation: Needs testing and validation
- Verify AI behavior at different difficulties

**Files to Check**:
- `engine/battlescape/ai/` (AI modules)
- `engine/geoscape/` (mission generation)

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Important for game balance

#### 3.3: Performance Optimization
- LOS system already has `los_optimized.lua`
- Consider:
  - Damage calculation caching
  - Projectile path caching
  - Psionic ability range pre-calculation

**Files**: `engine/battlescape/combat/` (various)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: LOW - Only needed if performance issues arise

## File Organization

### Core Files Already Well-Organized
```
engine/battlescape/combat/          (15 files, well-structured)
engine/battlescape/ui/              (2 files, clean)
engine/battlescape/systems/         (various supporting systems)
engine/battlescape/battle/          (battle flow logic)
```

### Documentation Already Comprehensive
```
wiki/systems/Battlescape.md         (2031 lines, detailed)
docs/BATTLESCAPE_AUDIT.md           (this audit)
docs/BATTLESCAPE_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md (testing guide)
```

### No Reorganization Needed ✅
- Structure follows best practices
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to locate and modify systems
