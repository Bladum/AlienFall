Networked gameplay framework enabling cooperative and competitive experiences.

## üåê Network Architecture

### Client-Server Model
Distributed game architecture for multiplayer functionality.

**Architecture Components:**
- **Dedicated Server**: Central game state authority
- **Client Synchronization**: Local state mirroring server state
- **State Validation**: Server-side move validation and conflict resolution
- **Latency Compensation**: Prediction and reconciliation systems

### Synchronization System
Maintaining consistent game state across all players.

**Synchronization Features:**
- **Deterministic Simulation**: Identical outcomes from same inputs
- **State Broadcasting**: Regular game state updates to all clients
- **Input Queuing**: Ordered command processing and execution
- **Rollback System**: Correction of prediction errors

## üéÆ Game Modes

### Cooperative Modes
Team-based gameplay against AI or scenario challenges.

**Co-op Features:**
- **Shared Command**: Joint control of organization resources
- **Divided Responsibilities**: Specialized roles (combat, research, economy)
- **Synchronized Turns**: Coordinated strategic decision making
- **Victory Conditions**: Team success requirements

### Competitive Modes
Player versus player strategic competition.

**Competitive Features:**
- **Head-to-Head**: Direct organizational competition
- **Asymmetric Objectives**: Different victory conditions
- **Economic Warfare**: Resource competition and sabotage
- **Diplomatic Intrigue**: Alliance and betrayal mechanics

## üéØ Multiplayer Features

### Lobby System
Matchmaking and pre-game organization.

**Lobby Features:**
- **Room Creation**: Custom game setup and configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges

### Determinism
Ensuring identical game outcomes across different systems.

**Determinism Solutions:**
- **Fixed Random Seeds**: Controlled randomness for reproducibility
- **Input Ordering**: Strict command execution sequence
- **State Verification**: Regular checksum validation
- **Desync Detection**: Automatic error identification and correction

### Latency Handling
Managing network delays in turn-based gameplay.

**Latency Solutions:**
- **Turn Buffering**: Allow time for all player inputs
- **Prediction Systems**: Client-side action anticipation
- **Reconciliation**: Server correction of prediction errors
- **Grace Periods**: Flexible timing for variable connections

### State Synchronization
Maintaining consistent game world across network.

**Synchronization Methods:**
- **Delta Updates**: Send only changed game state
- **Compression**: Efficient data transmission
- **Prioritization**: Critical updates sent first
- **Interpolation**: Smooth state transitions

## üéØ Multiplayer Experience
