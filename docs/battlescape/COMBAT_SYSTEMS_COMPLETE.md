# Combat Systems Implementation - Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Core Systems 95% Complete

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of 4 major combat system integrations into the XCOM Simple tactical engine. These systems provide deep tactical gameplay with damage models, weapon modes, psionics, critical hits, and wound tracking.

---

## 1. Damage Models System ✅ (100% Complete)

### What It Does
Determines how damage is distributed across unit stats (health, stun, morale, energy) and provides automatic recovery per turn.

### Implementation
- **4 Damage Models:**
  - `hurt`: 75% HP + 25% stun (lethal weapons)
  - `stun`: 100% stun (non-lethal capture)
  - `morale`: 100% morale (suppression/fear)
  - `energy`: 80% EP + 20% stun (plasma/energy drain)

- **Recovery System:**
  - Stun: -2 per turn (wake up from unconsciousness)
  - Morale: +5 per turn (recover from panic)
  - Energy: +3 per turn (recharge stamina)

- **API:**
  - `WeaponSystem.getDamageType(weaponId)` - Get armor resistance type
  - `WeaponSystem.getDamageModel(weaponId)` - Get stat distribution type
  - `DamageSystem.distributeDamage(...)` - Apply damage with model

---

## 2. Critical Hit System ✅ (90% Complete)

### What It Does
Adds critical hit mechanics with weapon precision bonuses and class expertise bonuses, causing extra damage and bleeding wounds.

### Implementation
- **Critical Hit Formula:**
  - Base chance from weapon (0-15%)
  - Plus class bonus (0-15%)
  - Plus aim stat bonus (aim/10%)
  - Roll 1-100, success if <= total chance

- **Critical Hit Effects:**
  - 2x damage multiplier
  - Applies bleeding wound with source tracking
  - "CRITICAL HIT!" combat log message

---

## 3. Weapon Modes System ✅ (70% Complete)

### What It Does
Provides 6 universal firing modes for all weapons with tactical tradeoffs (accuracy vs AP cost vs special effects).

### Implementation
- **6 Firing Modes:**
  - `SNAP`: Fast shot (low AP, reduced accuracy)
  - `AIM`: Careful shot (standard accuracy, standard AP)
  - `LONG`: Sniper shot (high accuracy, high AP, range bonus)
  - `AUTO`: Burst fire (5 bullets, moderate accuracy)
  - `HEAVY`: Power shot (high damage, high EP cost, armor penetration)
  - `FINESSE`: Precision strike (crit bonus, moderate AP)

- **Mode Mechanics:**
  - Each mode modifies: accuracy, AP cost, EP cost, damage, crit chance
  - AUTO mode fires 5 individual bullets with separate hit rolls
  - LONG mode extends range by 50%
  - HEAVY mode adds +2 damage and armor penetration
  - FINESSE mode adds +10% crit chance

---

## 4. Psionics System ✅ (95% Complete)

### What It Does
Provides 11 mental abilities for psionic units to damage, control, manipulate terrain, and buff allies.

### Implementation
- **11 Psionic Abilities:**

  **Damage Abilities (3):**
  - `PSI_DAMAGE`: Mental attack (10-20 damage, will resistance check)
  - `PSI_CRITICAL`: Guaranteed crit buff (1 attack, 100% crit chance)
  - `DAMAGE_TERRAIN`: Psychokinetic blast (destroy terrain, 3 hex radius)

  **Environmental Abilities (4):**
  - `UNCOVER_TERRAIN`: Fog reveal (5 hex radius, 3 turn duration)
  - `MOVE_TERRAIN`: Telekinesis on tiles (max 3 tile range)
  - `CREATE_FIRE`: Pyrokinesis (intensity 3 fire, spreads)
  - `CREATE_SMOKE`: Smoke generation (3 hex radius, 5 density)

  **Control/Buff Abilities (4):**
  - `MOVE_OBJECT`: Telekinesis (50kg max, throw as weapon)
  - `MIND_CONTROL`: Domination (3 turns, team switching)
  - `SLOW_UNIT`: AP debuff (-2 AP, 2 turns)
  - `HASTE_UNIT`: AP buff (+2 AP, 2 turns)

---

## 5. Wound Tracking System ✅ (100% Complete)

### What It Does
Tracks individual wounds with full source attribution for medical treatment and automatic bleeding damage.

### Implementation
- **Individual Wound Tracking:**
  - Each wound in `unit.woundList` array
  - Wound data: id, turn, weaponId, attackerId, damageType, bleedRate, stabilized
  - Full provenance: weapon type, who attacked, turn number

- **Bleeding Mechanics:**
  - Each wound causes bleeding (default 1 HP/turn)
  - Total bleeding calculated from active wounds
  - Processed automatically each turn

- **Stabilization System:**
  - Stops specific wound bleeding without removal
  - Enables medical treatment (medkit stabilizes)

---

## Status Effects System ✅ (100% Complete)

### What It Does
Manages temporary buffs/debuffs with automatic duration tracking and effect application.

### Implementation
- **4 Status Effect Types:**

  **Mind Control:**
  - Target switches to attacker's team
  - Duration: 3 turns

  **Slow Effect:**
  - Target loses 2 AP each turn
  - Duration: 2 turns

  **Haste Effect:**
  - Target gains 2 AP each turn
  - Duration: 2 turns

  **Psi Critical Buff:**
  - Next attack guaranteed critical hit
  - Single use (consumed on attack)

- Edge case: Unit death from bleeding
- Edge case: AUTO mode with low ammo
- Edge case: Psi resistance at extreme values
- Balance: Wound bleeding rates
- Balance: Psi energy costs
