## Detailed Findings

### 1. Data Integration ✅

**Finding**: All region data structures properly integrated into world system.

**Evidence**:
- ProvinceGraph correctly manages province network
- Region properties stored in base province entities
- Climate/biome data properly propagated
- Population data accessible and accurate

**Status**: PASS

---

### 2. Mission Generation Impact ✅

**Finding**: Region properties correctly affect mission generation.

**Mechanics Verified**:
- Region climate determines available terrain types
- Region population affects enemy unit count
- Region owner determines faction presence
- Regional difficulty modifiers applied correctly

**Example**:
```
High population region + Desert climate = Many enemies, Harsh terrain
Low population region + Forest = Few enemies, Dense cover
```

**Status**: PASS

---

### 3. Recruitment System ✅

**Finding**: Region population properly affects recruitment mechanics.

**Mechanics Verified**:
- Region population pool sizes correct
- Higher population regions generate more recruits
- Population diversity affects quality variance
- Recruitment costs scale with population

**Status**: PASS

---

### 4. Ownership Tracking ✅

**Finding**: Region ownership system fully operational.

**Mechanics Verified**:
- Owner nations properly tracked per region
- Allegiance changes propagate correctly
- Contested regions properly marked
- Ownership affects diplomatic standing

**Status**: PASS

---
