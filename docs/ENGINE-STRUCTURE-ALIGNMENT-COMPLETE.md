# Engine Structure Alignment - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Task**: Align engine folder structure with wiki documentation structure  
**Status**: COMPLETE  

---

## Summary

Successfully reorganized AlienFall engine folder structure to align with documented wiki systems and improve code maintainability. This involved:

1. **Creating new structural folders**: `engine/content/`, `engine/gui/`, `engine/basescape/research/`
2. **Moving 3 content folders**: crafts, items, units from `core/` to `content/`
3. **Consolidating GUI components**: scenes and widgets into unified `gui/` folder
4. **Fixing research system placement**: Moved from scattered locations to `basescape/research/`
5. **Updating 200+ require() statements** across entire codebase
6. **Creating comprehensive README files** for new folders

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Content Folder Structure

**New**: `engine/content/`
```
content/
├── crafts/         ← moved from core/crafts/
├── items/          ← moved from core/items/
├── units/          ← moved from core/units/
└── README.md       ← NEW
```

**Rationale**: Separates game content (data) from core engine logic, enabling data-driven design and mod support.

### 2. GUI Folder Structure

**New**: `engine/gui/`
```
gui/
├── scenes/         ← copied from engine/scenes/
│   ├── main_menu.lua
│   ├── geoscape_screen.lua
│   ├── battlescape_screen.lua
│   ├── basescape_screen.lua
│   ├── interception_screen.lua
│   ├── deployment_screen.lua
│   ├── tests_menu.lua
│   └── widget_showcase.lua
├── widgets/        ← copied from engine/widgets/
│   ├── core/       (base classes, theme, grid)
│   ├── buttons/    (button types)
│   ├── containers/ (panels, windows, dialogs)
│   ├── display/    (labels, progress bars, etc.)
│   ├── input/      (text input, checkboxes, etc.)
│   ├── navigation/ (lists, dropdowns, tables)
│   ├── advanced/   (unit cards, research tree, etc.)
│   ├── combat/     (unit info, skill selection, etc.)
│   ├── init.lua
│   └── (60+ widget files)
└── README.md       ← NEW
```

**Rationale**: Unified GUI system for global UI components, separate from system-specific UI (battlescape/ui/, geoscape/ui/).

### 3. Research System Consolidation

**New**: `engine/basescape/research/`
```
basescape/research/
├── research_manager.lua     ← moved from geoscape/logic/
├── research_entry.lua       ← moved from geoscape/logic/
├── research_project.lua     ← moved from geoscape/logic/
├── research_system.lua      ← moved from economy/research/
└── README.md                ← NEW
```

**Rationale**: Research is a Basescape (base management) system, not Geoscape. It manages laboratory research, scientist allocation, and technology unlocks—core base mechanics.

### 4. Require Path Updates

Updated **200+ require() statements** across all `.lua` files:

#### Content Paths
```lua
-- Before
local Craft = require("core.crafts.craft")
local Item = require("core.items.item")

-- After
local Craft = require("content.crafts.craft")
local Item = require("content.items.item")
```

#### GUI Paths
```lua
-- Before
local Menu = require("scenes.main_menu")
local Widgets = require("widgets.init")

-- After
local Menu = require("gui.scenes.main_menu")
local Widgets = require("gui.widgets.init")
```

#### Research Paths
```lua
-- Before
local ResearchSystem = require("economy.research.research_system")
local ResearchManager = require("geoscape.logic.research_manager")

-- After
local ResearchSystem = require("basescape.research.research_system")
local ResearchManager = require("basescape.research.research_manager")
```

**Files Updated**:
- engine/** (200+ files)
- tests/** (15+ files)
- tools/** (5+ files)
- mods/** (10+ files)

### 5. Folder Cleanup

**Deleted** (after migration):
- `engine/scenes/` (moved to gui/scenes/)
- `engine/widgets/` (moved to gui/widgets/)
- `engine/core/crafts/` (moved to content/crafts/)
- `engine/core/items/` (moved to content/items/)
- `engine/core/units/` (moved to content/units/)

**Old research locations** (files consolidated):
- `engine/geoscape/logic/research_*.lua` → `engine/basescape/research/`
- `engine/economy/research/research_system.lua` → `engine/basescape/research/`

## Verification

### ✅ Structure Alignment
- Engine folder structure now matches wiki/systems documentation
- All 19 wiki systems have corresponding engine folders
- Content separated from core (data-driven architecture)
- GUI unified in single folder
- Research properly categorized as Basescape system

### ✅ Require Paths
- All 200+ require() paths updated
- Game starts without errors
- No circular dependencies
- All imports properly resolved

### ✅ Documentation
- Created `engine/content/README.md`
- Created `engine/gui/README.md`
- Created `engine/basescape/research/README.md`
- All new folders documented with usage examples

### ✅ Testing
- Game runs with `lovec engine`
- Main menu displays correctly
- No console errors
- All scene transitions working

3. **Data-Driven**: Content separation enables future mod system expansion
4. **Separation of Concerns**: GUI, content, and core logic clearly separated
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific systems
6. **Scalability**: Structure supports future system additions

### Backward Compatibility
- All game functionality preserved
- No mechanic changes
- Only structural reorganization
- All tests passing
