## Lore 

### Overview

The lore system manages enemy organizations through a dynamic faction-based campaign structure. Each faction represents an independent threat with its own goals, resources, and technological advancement. Factions continuously generate new missions and threats, creating escalating pressure on the player organization. The system is designed to remain challenging without becoming overwhelmingly unmanageable, similar to Tower Defense mechanics where waves progressively strengthen.

### Factions

**Overview**
Factions are the primary enemy groups opposing the player. Each faction is fully autonomous with distinct units, resources, research trees, and campaign narratives. Factions represent competing alien civilizations or enemy organizations, each pursuing independent strategic goals.

**Faction Components**
- **Unit Classes**: Faction-specific soldier types and leaders
- **Campaign System**: Generates missions on a regular schedule
- **Resource Tree**: Independent economy and manufacturing
- **Technology Research**: Separate advancement tree exclusive to faction
- **Mission Generation**: Automated mission creation system
- **Story Arc**: Unique narrative progression for each faction

**Strategic Depth**
- Factions operate independently; defeating one doesn't affect others
- Stronger factions emerge over time, requiring player adaptation
- Each faction has preferred operational regions
- Faction relationships affect mission frequency and difficulty

### Races

**Overview**
Races provide cosmetic and categorical classification for unit classes. Each race is assigned to unit classes, primarily for user interface filtering and thematic organization. Races do not provide statistical bonuses or mechanical advantages.

**Racial System**
- Each unit class belongs to a specific race
- Races are primarily for filtering in UI and organization
- No statistical bonuses associated with race itself
- Typical factions employ 1-3 races
- All race-based gameplay differentiation comes from unit class statistics

**Design Rationale**
Separating race from mechanics ensures balanced gameplay while maintaining thematic diversity. Players see variety without game-breaking statistical advantages based purely on cosmetic choices.

### Campaign System

**Overview**
Campaigns are coordinated series of missions generated by active factions. Each campaign represents an enemy operational plan consisting of sequential missions deployed over weeks, with specific objectives and scaling difficulty.

**Campaign Structure**
- Duration: Typically spans 6-10 weeks (per campaign)
- Mission Count: Approximately 5 missions per campaign
- Scheduling: Missions release on set intervals (e.g., Week 1, Week 3, Week 6, Week 7, Week 9)
- Regional Focus: Campaigns target specific regions based on faction preferences
- Conclusion: Campaign ends after final mission deploys; faction may launch new campaign

**Mission Generation Schedule**
Within each campaign:
- Initial mission deploys immediately
- Subsequent missions release at predetermined intervals (2-3 week gaps typical)
- Final mission marks campaign conclusion
- New campaign initiates next month

**Campaign Escalation Formula**
- Base campaigns per month: 2 (Quarter 1)
- Escalation rate: +1 new campaign per quarter (Q2=3/month, Q3=4/month, Q4=5/month, etc.)
- Maximum campaigns capped at 10 per month
- Multiple factions compound escalation (each faction independent)
- Failed player defenses can unlock bonus campaigns

**Faction Regional Preferences**
- Factions concentrate operations in preferred regions
- Asian factions operate primarily in Asian territories (~80% operations)
- American factions focus on North American operations (~70% operations)
- European factions have balanced global presence
- Regional specialization affects mission selection and intensity
- Players can predict campaign timing based on faction patterns

**Scaling Difficulty**
- Early campaigns (first month): Basic threats, standard units
- Middle campaigns (months 2-6): Intermediate threats, upgraded equipment
- Late campaigns (6+ months): Advanced threats, elite alien units
- Each new faction campaign poses increased challenge
- Activating multiple campaigns simultaneously increases pressure exponentially
- Failed interceptions accelerate campaign timelines

### Mission Types

**Overview**
Missions are the primary player interaction with the threat system. Three distinct mission types exist, each with unique characteristics, persistence, and strategic implications. Mission diversity creates varied tactical challenges and strategic decision points.

---

#### Mission Site

**Definition**
Temporary mission locations representing specific incidents (UFO crash sites, alien scout positions, refugee centers under attack). Sites are time-limited tactical engagements requiring immediate response.

**Characteristics**
- **Duration**: 9 days after discovery (player action timer)
- **Movement**: Static; does not relocate
- **Persistence**: Temporary; expires after time limit or completion
- **Activation**: Requires player radar detection or direct observation
- **Completion**: Player-driven; player chooses when to engage
- **Reward**: Variable points upon completion (50-500 depending on mission type)
- **Consequence**: Mission disappears if time expires without player interception (no penalty)
- **Visibility**: Becomes visible on Geoscape when radar detects
- **Difficulty Scaling**: UFO size and unit count scales with player level

**Site Type Variations**

| Site Type | Typical Duration | Enemy Forces | Objectives | Reward |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Crash Site | 7-9 days | Small (2-4 units) | Secure wreckage | 50-100 points |
| Scout Post | 5-7 days | Tiny (1-2 units) | Eliminate scouts | 30-50 points |
| Harvest Site | 9-12 days | Small-Medium (4-6) | Interrupt harvest | 100-150 points |
| Refugee Center | 3-5 days | Medium (6-8) | Protect evacuation | 150-200 points |
| Research Site | 10-14 days | Medium (8-10) | Retrieve samples | 200-300 points |
| Military Camp | 7-10 days | Large (10-15) | Destroy command | 300-500 points |

**Strategic Considerations**
- Player must locate and intercept within time window
- Failure to intercept allows mission to complete alien objectives
- Sites appear randomly across visible Geoscape
- Multiple sites can exist simultaneously
- Early interception prevents objective completion
- Difficulty scales with player organization level
- Regional stability affects site frequency (war zones more frequent)
- Ignoring sites allows enemy faction to accumulate points

**Tactical Implications**
- Site-specific terrain affects battle conditions
- Unique objective conditions (protect civilians, secure artifacts)
- Failure consequences vary by site type
- Success against sites builds player reputation in region

#### Mission Base

**Definition**
Permanent enemy strongholds that grow and strengthen over time. Alien bases are the equivalent of player bases, generating subordinate missions and threatening surrounding provinces. Bases represent existential threats requiring long-term strategic response.

**Characteristics**
- **Persistence**: Permanent until destroyed by player (entire campaign threat)
- **Growth**: Develops through 4 progressive levels
  - Level 1: Initial establishment, weak defensive capability
    - Generates 1 mission per week
    - Low threat to adjacent bases (-10 military pressure)
    - ~50-100 defending units
  - Level 2: Expanded operations, moderate threat
    - Generates 2 missions per week
    - Moderate threat to adjacent bases (-25 military pressure)
    - ~100-200 defending units
  - Level 3: Fortified position, significant military presence
    - Generates 3 missions per week
    - High threat to adjacent bases (-50 military pressure)
    - ~200-400 defending units
  - Level 4: Full operational capability, severe threat
    - Generates 4-5 missions per week
    - Severe threat to adjacent bases (-100 military pressure)
    - ~400-800 defending units
    - Attempts assault on nearby player bases (1-2 per month)
- **Movement**: Static; never relocates
- **Generated Missions**: Spawns reconnaissance, resource gathering, and assault missions as it grows
- **Threat Escalation**: Higher level bases attempt to assault player bases with increasing frequency
- **Scoring**: Awards enemy faction 5-10 points per week (existence score)
- **Special Mechanic**: Base script triggers progression checks and mission generation

**Base Progression Timeline**
```
Time to Establish: 30-60 days
Time per Level Advancement: 30-45 days
Total to Full Level 4: 120-180 days (3.5-6 months)
Growth acceleration: +20% per active mission completed from base
Growth deceleration: -30% per assault mission launched from base
```

**Base Script System**
- Runs daily during dawn cycle (predictable timing)
- Checks if base has met level progression conditions
- Initiates new mission generation if conditions met
- Continues indefinitely until base destroyed by player
- Represents growing enemy presence and resource accumulation
- Base level determines mission types generated (higher levels = tougher missions)

**Defensive Measures**
- Player bases adjacent to enemy base: -25% facility efficiency (pressure)
- Long-range bombardment: 10% chance per month to damage enemy base (-1 level progression time)
- Espionage: Steal base construction plans (+30% player knowledge, -20% enemy progression)
- Alliance assistance: Allies attack base (-15% enemy progression)

**Strategic Implications**
- Bases represent long-term existential threats requiring sustained resources
- Allowing bases to advance increases overall campaign difficulty exponentially
- Destroying bases disrupts enemy operational capability (faction loses 100 points)
- Early intervention prevents maximum-level fortifications
- Base proximity negatively impacts player base performance
- Delayed action allows bases to threaten multiple player regions
- Late-game bases require significant military commitment to destroy

**Base Elimination Mechanics**
- Can be attacked by player craft and ground forces
- Requires multiple assault missions to destroy
- Defense scales with base level
- Destruction grants substantial victory points (200-500)
- Faction temporarily weakened after base loss (-3 missions/month for 1 month)
- Base rebuilding possible in same region (6+ months)

#### Mission UFO

**Definition**
Mobile enemy craft executing predetermined missions (recon flights, resource gathering, transport operations, assault missions). UFOs represent active military operations and intelligence gathering. UFOs provide high-value interception targets.

**Characteristics**
- **Movement**: Continuously mobile; follows scripted patrol route (speed 1-2 hexes/day typical)
- **Persistence**: Temporary; disappears after mission completion (3-14 days typical duration)
- **Script-Based**: Follows predetermined mission script with sequential steps
- **Scoring System**: 
  - Awards points upon mission completion (+50-200)
  - Awards points upon completion of each script step (+10-50 per step)
  - Multiple opportunities for gradual point accumulation
- **Activation**: Detected via radar or direct observation
- **Mechanics**: Movement, landing, resource gathering, repositioning between regions
- **Consequence**: UFO departs after mission conclusion; points awarded to faction
- **UFO Types**:
  - Scout ships: Small, fast, 1-2 crew
  - Transport: Medium, moderate speed, 4-6 crew
  - Assault craft: Large, slower, 8-12 crew
  - Command vessel: Very large, slow, 15-20 crew (rare)

**UFO Script System**
```
Each UFO has predefined mission steps:
- Travel to region (1-3 days)
- Land at location (1-2 days)
- Gather resources or accomplish objective (2-5 days)
- Engage targets if intercepted (0 or more days)
- Relocate to next region (1-3 days)
- Final departure or loop (end or restart)

Point Award Formula:
Base Points = (UFO Type Base Value) × (Mission Complexity) × (Player Level Factor)
Step Completion = +10-50 points per step
Mission Completion = +50-200 points total
```

- Every completed step awards enemy faction score points
- Multiple step completions allow for graduated scoring
- UFO behavior appears intelligent due to scripted patterns
- UFO can return to same region multiple times (repeating profitable routes)

**UFO Interception Mechanics**
```
Interception Difficulty = (UFO Speed × Distance Remaining × Time Until Escape)
Craft Requirement = Speed > UFO Speed to intercept
```
- UFOs must be intercepted before completing mission and departing
- Faster craft have higher interception success rate
- Multiple interceptor locations improve success probability
- Missed interceptions allow UFO to escape (mission completes, points awarded to faction)

**Strategic Considerations**
- UFOs represent active military operations in progress
- Intercepting UFOs mid-mission prevents objective completion (no points to faction)
- Early interception in script execution prevents follow-up steps
- Multiple UFOs operating simultaneously create difficult tactical scenarios
- UFO routes can be predicted based on observable patterns
- Common routes develop over multiple campaigns
- Resource-rich regions attract repeated UFO visits

**UFO Fleet Tactics**
- Multiple UFOs from same faction may coordinate routes
- Fleet arrival indicates major campaign operation
- Destroying UFO in fleet may trigger retaliation mission
- Fleet patterns reveal faction strategic focus

### Quest System

**Overview**
Quests are optional objectives that provide rewards for completing specific conditions within time limits. Quests offer varied challenges and incentivize specific playstyles and achievements. Quests serve as secondary objectives beyond primary mission/base destruction.

**Quest Mechanics**
- **Objective**: Specific goal (e.g., "Achieve 100 score in Province X during current month")
- **Reward**: Bonus rewards upon completion (e.g., "+2 Power Points", "+1000 credits", "+15 fame")
- **Duration**: Variable; typically 1 month to several months
- **Triggers**: Can be initiated by random events, faction actions, or faction achievements
- **Verification**: Checked daily at dawn cycle
- **Failure**: Incomplete quests expire when duration ends (no penalty)
- **Display**: Tracked in quest log with progress indicator
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Quest complexity scales with player organization level

**Quest Variety**

| Quest Type | Duration | Objective | Reward | Difficulty |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Military | 2-4 weeks | Destroy 5 UFOs in region | +2 Power Points | Medium |
| Economic | 1-2 months | Earn 50K credits | +1000 credits | Low |
| Diplomatic | 4-8 weeks | Achieve +50 relation with country | +5 fame | Medium |
| Organizational | 2-3 months | Build 3 bases | +3 Power Points | Medium-High |
| Research | 3-6 months | Complete 5 research projects | +2000 credits | Medium |
| Heroic | Variable | Destroy alien base | +5 Power Points, +50 fame | High |
| Regional | 1 month | Dominate region (90% control) | +500 credits, +1000 points | High |
| Survival | 2-4 weeks | Defend bases for full duration | +3 Power Points | Variable |

**Strategic Integration**
- Quests encourage long-term planning and goal-setting
- Multiple quests can be active simultaneously (typically 3-5)
- Quest completion provides secondary progression path
- Optional nature allows players to focus on core objectives
- Difficulty scaling ensures relevance throughout campaign
- Failed quests provide learning opportunities without punishment
- Quest rewards supplement other progression systems
- Multiple quests can run simultaneously
- Quest failure has no penalty (they simply expire)

**Event Probability Factors**
```
Event Roll = Daily × (1 + Organization Level × 0.1) × (Fame Factor) × (Karma Factor)
Organization Level: 1-10 (affects frequency)
Fame Factor: 0.5-1.5 (famous = more events)
Karma Factor: 0.7-1.3 (extreme alignments = more events)
```

**Branching Events** (Player Choice)
Some events offer multiple outcomes:
- **Market Crisis**: (A) Accept losses, (B) Negotiate with suppliers, (C) Emergency fund withdrawal
- **Alliance Opportunity**: (A) Accept immediately, (B) Negotiate terms, (C) Decline
- **Diplomatic Incident**: (A) Apologize (-relation penalty, +cost), (B) Deny involvement (-relation, low cost)
- **Facility Damage**: (A) Repair normally (time/cost), (B) Temporary fix (faster, worse efficiency)

**Long-Term Event Consequences**
- Multiple similar events can create narrative chains
- Event outcomes may unlock future events
- Repeated market crashes lead to economic depression
- Multiple personnel desertions create morale crisis event
- Continued research setbacks trigger equipment failure

**Lore Integration**
- Events exist as gameplay mechanics rather than story-driven narrative
- Events represent environmental factors and external pressures
- No direct connection to lore narrative (separate from faction storylines)
- Purpose: Add unpredictability and challenge variety
- Emerges gameplay storytelling through consequence chains

**Strategic Consideration**
- Players cannot predict or prevent events
- Event consequences require adaptive responses
- Events can derail carefully planned strategies
- Positive events provide opportunities for advancement
- Some events create ethical dilemmas (choice-based events)
- High fame + evil karma = more frequent negative events
- Defensive organization structure reduces event impact

### Calendar System

**Overview**
The Calendar is the core time management system that orchestrates all major events and mission generation. It ensures consistent content generation and system checks, providing structure to the game's temporal progression.

**Calendar Schedule**

**Monthly (1st of each month)**
- Generate new campaign for active factions
- Assess which factions remain active (based on forces, resources, strategic position)
- Check faction relationship changes (based on player actions last month)
- Process monthly funding allocation (based on country relations)
- Reset monthly availability counters (marketplace stock, supplier limits)
- Update supply line deliveries (if established)
- Process advisor monthly salary payments

**Weekly (Every 6 days)**
- Active campaigns generate new missions (based on schedule)
- Check if pending missions should activate (time-dependent)
- Process weekly base script checks for enemy bases (progression checks)
- Award base maintenance points (represent ongoing operations)
- Reset weekly resource generation (marketplace, factories)
- Process weekly personnel morale adjustments

**Daily (Every 24 hours)**
- UFO mission scripts progress: movement, landing, resource gathering, repositioning
- UFO missions advance to next step; award step completion points
- Mission site completion checks: Remove expired mission sites
- Mission base script execution: Check for level advancement, generate subordinate missions
- Quest verification: Check if players completed quest objectives
- Event generation: Roll for new random events (frequency based on level)
- Craft radar scans for mission detection (automated)
- Base radar scans for mission detection (automated)
- Player organization income generation (daily fraction of monthly funding)
- Personnel experience gain: +1 experience per soldier per day (passive training)
- Supply line progression: Reduce transfer time counters

**Time Units**
- 1 day = smallest time unit
- 1 week = 6 days (calendar weeks, not Earth weeks)
- 1 month = 28 days (4 weeks)
- 1 quarter = 3 months (12 weeks)
- 1 year = 4 quarters (12 months, 48 weeks, 336 days)

**Automation Benefits**
- No player intervention required; systems operate autonomously
- Consistent content generation maintains engagement
- Predictable scheduling allows long-term planning
- Difficulty scaling happens gradually through accumulation
- Time pressure creates strategic urgency

**Player Interaction Points**
- Players observe generated missions via Geoscape radar
- Players decide when to intercept missions
- Players determine campaign response strategies
- Players manage resulting consequences of events
- Players can manage time through pause/accelerate functions

---

### Enemy Scoring System

**Overview**
The enemy faction scoring system parallels and mirrors the player scoring system, representing how well enemy factions advance their objectives. This creates a sense of urgency and consequence for player inaction.

**Scoring Events**

**Campaign-Level Scoring**
- **Campaign Creation**: +20 points (baseline for launching campaign)
- **Campaign Completion**: +30-50 points (varies by campaign type)
- **Mission Generation**: +5 points per mission spawned within campaign (cumulative)
- **Campaign Success**: +100 points (all missions completed without player interference)

**Mission-Level Scoring**
- **Mission Site**: 
  - +50-150 points when mission completes (time expires or player fails to intercept)
  - -50 points if player successfully intercepts
  - +0 points if site expires without alien completion (rare)
- **Mission UFO**: 
  - +50-200 points upon UFO mission completion (departs successfully)
  - +10-50 points per mission step completed (before departure)
  - -100 points if player destroys UFO
  - -50 points if player damages/forces UFO retreat
- **Mission Base**: 
  - +10 points per week base remains active (regardless of player action)
  - +50 points per level advancement
  - +200 points if base successfully assaults player base
  - -100 points if player destroys base (-reduces faction threat significantly)
  - -25 points if player damages base (delays progression)

**Scoring Formula**
```
Monthly Enemy Score = Σ(All Faction Scores)
Campaign Score = Base 20 + Mission Score × Completion Rate
Enemy Threat Level = Monthly Score / 100 (capped at 10)
```

**Consequence System**
```
Enemy Threat Level = Monthly Score / 100
- Level 1-3 (Low): 1-2 campaigns/month, basic units
- Level 4-6 (Medium): 3-4 campaigns/month, upgraded units  
- Level 7-9 (High): 5-6 campaigns/month, elite units
- Level 10+ (Critical): Multiple simultaneous campaigns, max unit deployment
```
- Higher faction scores increase threat level
- Multiple active factions increase cumulative scoring speed
- Unopposed factions accelerate their advancement dramatically (+50% bonus to scoring)
- Player can reduce enemy scoring through:
  - Mission interception: Direct scoring reduction
  - Base destruction: Eliminate ongoing scoring source
  - Campaign prevention: Early interception before mission generation
  - Diplomatic pressure: Reduce faction activity

**Player Response Strategies**
- Focus on base destruction to eliminate persistent threats
- Prioritize high-value UFO interceptions to reduce mission step scoring
- Intercept mission sites early to prevent objective completion
- Establish supply lines to maintain offensive posture
- Use diplomatic relations to reduce faction pressure temporarily

**Strategic Depth**
- Players must prioritize threats to prevent escalation
- Allowing bases to advance quickly accelerates enemy scoring
- Multiple simultaneous campaigns create overwhelming pressure
- Defeating campaigns disrupts enemy momentum
