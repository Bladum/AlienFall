## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Create final MOD_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (2-3 hours)
2. ✅ Mark Step 3 as complete
3. ✅ Proceed to Step 4: Mock Data Generation

### Why This Is Important
- Step 3 provides foundation for all remaining steps
- Mock data generation (Step 4) requires complete API documentation
- Example mods (Step 5) need both API docs and mock data
- All subsequent steps build on Step 3

### Quality Checkpoints
- ✅ All schemas complete and validated
- ✅ All examples working and tested
- ✅ All systems documented
- ✅ All balance guidelines included
- ✅ Ready for mock data generation
