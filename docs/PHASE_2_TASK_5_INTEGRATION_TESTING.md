# Phase 2 Task 5: Complete Integration Testing

**Task ID**: TASK-5  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Date Started**: October 21, 2025  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours  

---

## Overview

Comprehensive integration testing of the complete game loop to verify all systems work together correctly:
- Application startup → Mod loading → Main menu
- New Game creation → Geoscape initialization
- Mission selection → Battlescape entry
- Turn-based combat → Mission completion
- State transitions → Save/Load functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

**Goal**: Verify full game loop functions without errors, console warnings, or unexpected behavior. Identify any issues for Tasks 6-8.
