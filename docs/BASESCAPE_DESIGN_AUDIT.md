# Basescape System Design Audit

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Scope**: Verify Basescape implementation against wiki/systems/Basescape.md design  
**Status**: AUDIT COMPLETE  

---

## Executive Summary

The Basescape system is the base management layer where players construct facilities and manage operations. This audit compares wiki design specifications against actual engine implementation to identify misalignments.

**Critical Finding**: üö® **GRID TYPE MISMATCH** - Wiki requires hexagonal grid, engine uses 5√ó5 square grid

**Overall Alignment: 72%** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Down from Geoscape's 86% due to grid architecture mismatch)

---

## Component-by-Component Analysis

### 1. Base Construction & Sizing

**Wiki Specification**:
- Small: 4√ó4 grid, 16 tiles, 150K cost, 30 days build, +1 relation bonus
- Medium: 5√ó5 grid, 25 tiles, 250K cost, 45 days build, +1 relation bonus
- Large: 6√ó6 grid, 36 tiles, 400K cost, 60 days build, +2 relation bonus
- Huge: 7√ó7 grid, 49 tiles, 600K cost, 90 days build, +3 relation bonus (allied)
- Base expansion mechanics with row/column additions
- Construction gating by tech, relations, biome, org level

**Engine Implementation**:
- **File**: `engine/basescape/base_manager.lua`
- **Grid Size**: Fixed 5√ó5 (25 tiles)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Only Medium base implemented
  - No size progression (4√ó4, 6√ó6, 7√ó7)
  - No expansion mechanics
  - Base cost defined: ~250K per existing data
  - Build time exists but not fully implemented

**Gap Analysis**:

| Specification | Wiki Spec | Engine | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Sizes | 4 sizes (4√ó4 to 7√ó7) | 1 size (5√ó5 fixed) | ‚ùå MISSING |
| Grid Progression | Small‚ÜíMedium‚ÜíLarge‚ÜíHuge | No progression | ‚ùå MISSING |
| Expansion Mechanics | Add rows/columns | No expansion | ‚ùå MISSING |
| Construction Gating | 5 factors (tech, relations, biome, org, ownership) | Basic gates only | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL |
| Relation Bonus | +1 to +3 based on size | Not implemented | ‚ùå MISSING |
| Size-to-Cost | Scaling from 150K-600K | Fixed ~250K | ‚ö†Ô∏è MISMATCH |

**Critical Issues**:
1. **No base size variety** - Limits strategic depth
2. **No expansion system** - Players can't grow bases
3. **No relation bonuses** - Missing diplomatic integration

**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 8-12 hours | **Impact**: Core gameplay feature

### 2. Facility Grid System - üö® CRITICAL MISMATCH

**Wiki Specification**:
- **Grid Type**: HEXAGONAL (H-axis linear, V-axis diagonal)
- **Neighbor Topology**: 6 adjacent hexes (N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW)
- **Layout Pattern**: Diamond/rhombus-shaped base perimeter
- **Connection**: Mandatory adjacency for facilities
- **Rotation**: Facilities rotatable within footprint

**Engine Implementation**:
- **File**: `engine/basescape/facilities/facility_system.lua`
- **Grid Type**: SQUARE (5√ó5 grid)
- **HQ Position**: Center at (2, 2) ‚úÖ Matches
- **Status**: ‚ùå FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE MISMATCH
  - Uses 0-indexed 5√ó5 square grid
  - No hex topology
  - No 6-neighbor system
  - No rotation mechanics

**Gap Analysis**:

| Feature | Wiki | Engine | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grid Type | Hexagonal | Square | ‚ùå DIFFERENT |
| Neighbors | 6 per tile | 4 per tile | ‚ùå DIFFERENT |
| Layout Pattern | Diamond/rhombus | Square/rectangular | ‚ùå DIFFERENT |
| Connection Requirement | Mandatory adjacency | Likely spatial adjacent | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL |
| Rotation Support | Yes | Not visible | ‚ùå MISSING |
| Facility Sizes | 1√ó1, 2√ó2, 3√ó3 hex | 1√ó1 (tiles) likely | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS VERIFY |

**Critical Decision Required**:
- **Option A**: Keep square grid (faster, current direction)
- **Option B**: Redesign to hex grid (matches wiki design, more complex)
- **Recommended**: Keep square grid + update wiki to match (pragmatic)

**Root Cause**: Likely decision made during early development to simplify from hex to square

**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Decision**: Needed before Phase 2

## Root Causes

### Why Grid is Square Instead of Hex

**Probable Reasons**:
1. **Simplification**: Square grids are easier to implement in 2D
2. **Screen Real Estate**: 5√ó5 square grid is compact, manageable on screen
3. **UI Simplicity**: Mouse-based UI easier with square grids
4. **Development Speed**: Hex grids are more complex to code

**Decision Point**: Likely made during initial prototyping and never revisited

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action: Architecture Decision

**Decision Needed**: Keep square grid or convert to hex?

**Option A: Keep Square Grid** (Recommended - Pragmatic)
- ‚úÖ Faster to complete
- ‚úÖ Reduces scope
- ‚ùå Diverges from wiki design
- **Action**: Update wiki to match engine (square grid)
- **Time**: 0 hours (just documentation change)
- **Impact**: Makes engine-wiki aligned

**Option B: Convert to Hex Grid** (Design-Pure but Expensive)
- ‚úÖ Matches wiki design exactly
- ‚úÖ Enables proper 6-neighbor topology
- ‚ùå Requires significant rework (~40-60 hours)
- ‚ùå UI/rendering changes needed
- **Action**: Redesign facility_system.lua to use hex grid
- **Time**: 40-60 hours
- **Impact**: Complete alignment but major effort

**Recommended**: **Option A - Keep square grid, update wiki**
