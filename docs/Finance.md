### Score System

**Overview**
The score system measures how effectively the player protects allied nations from alien threats. Score is separate from game success metrics; it directly impacts funding and relationships.

**Scoring Mechanics**
- Calculated at provincial level
- Aggregated monthly
- Grouped by region and country for reporting

**Score Gains**
- Neutralizing alien threats (UFOs, bases, missions)
- Saving civilian lives
- Destroying enemy mission sites and craft
- *Note: Destruction during collateral damage does NOT gain score*

**Score Losses**
- Civilian casualties
- Property destruction
- Failed missions
- Refusing mission interception requests

**Strategic Impact**
Score directly influences country relationships and funding levels, creating a feedback loop where successful operations lead to greater resources.

### Country Funding

**Overview**
Countries allocate defense budgets based on player performance. The player receives a percentage of each country's GDP monthly, proportional to the defense funding level assigned.

**Funding Calculation**
- Country economy = sum of all provincial economies
- Monthly score determines relationship changes:
  - Every 20 points awarded = ±1 relationship modifier
- Relationship range: -100 (hostile) to +100 (allied)
- Relationship determines funding level allocation

**Funding Levels**
- Scale: 0 to 10 levels
- Each level represents percentage of GDP allocated to defense (e.g., Level 6 = 6% of GDP)
- Player receives equivalent percentage of country GDP monthly as income
- Higher scores and good relationships increase funding levels
- Poor performance decreases funding

3. **Raid Loot Sales**: Selling equipment captured during non-mission battles and skirmishes
4. **Manufacturing Output**: Selling produced equipment on the marketplace
5. **Faction Tributes**: Diplomatic payments from factions for contracts and arrangements
6. **Supplier Discounts**: Price reductions from favorable supplier relationships

- **Equipment Purchases**: Buying items, units, craft, and facility components from marketplace
- **Personnel Maintenance**: Monthly upkeep for all soldiers and support personnel
- **Facility Maintenance**: Regular maintenance for all constructed facilities
- **Base Operations**: Electricity, supplies, and general base upkeep
- **Craft Operations**: Fuel and maintenance for aircraft and spacecraft

**Strategic Expenditures**
- **Black Market Services**: Paying for espionage, assassination, and illegal acquisitions
- **Diplomacy Costs**: Tributes, gifts, and negotiations with factions, suppliers, and countries
- **Fame Maintenance**: PR costs to maintain high public reputation

### Monthly Financial Report

**Statement Components**
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all income sources
- **Total Expenses**: Sum of all operational and strategic costs
- **Net Profit/Loss**: Monthly balance
- **Cash Reserves**: Current liquid assets
- **Funding Status**: Current country funding levels and relationships

**Player Review**
The monthly report provides complete financial transparency, allowing players to make informed decisions about base expansion, equipment purchases, and research priorities.

### Debt System

**Overview**
When cash reserves become depleted, players can take out loans to continue operations. Debt comes with mandatory repayment schedules and interest accumulation.

**Loan Mechanics**
- Standard loan: 100,000 Credits per month
- Interest rate: 5% per month (compounding)
- Mandatory repayment: Loan principal must be repaid before interest grows
- Consequences: Unpaid debt accrues interest at escalating rates

**Strategic Use**
- Temporary cash flow during equipment shortages
- Financing sudden expansion
- *Warning: Excessive debt can spiral into insolvency*

**Risk Management**
Players must carefully manage debt levels to avoid financial ruin, as excessive interest payments drain resources needed for operations.
