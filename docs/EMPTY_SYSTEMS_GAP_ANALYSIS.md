## üîÑ Integration Gap Analysis

### Critical Integration Points (Blocking Gameplay)

**1. Inventory System** (Blocks: Manufacturing, Marketplace, Salvage)
- Status: Referenced but not fully integrated
- Impact: Items don't persist after purchase/manufacture
- Solution: Complete inventory persistence in basescape
- Effort: 2-3 hours

**2. Research Unlock Checks** (Blocks: Manufacturing, Marketplace)
- Status: Referenced but not integrated
- Impact: Can manufacture/purchase unreserved items
- Solution: Integrate research system checks
- Effort: 1-2 hours

**3. Ability Effects** (Blocks: Combat completeness)
- Status: 4 abilities not implemented (turret, marked, suppression, fortify)
- Impact: Support, Scout, Heavy classes incomplete
- Solution: Implement 4 ability effects
- Effort: 8-12 hours total

**4. Team Placement** (Blocks: Mission startup)
- Status: Not implemented
- Impact: Units don't spawn at mission start
- Solution: Implement team placement algorithm
- Effort: 3-4 hours

**5. FactionManager Integration** (Blocks: Campaign dynamics)
- Status: 3 campaign manager TODOs depend on FactionManager
- Impact: Campaign missions hardcoded to aliens
- Solution: Wait for FactionManager or implement lightweight version
- Effort: 2-3 hours (after FactionManager exists)

- Complete redesign with content
- UI implementation
- Progression tracking

**Priority 7: Portal System** (4-6 hours planning + 10-15 hours implementation)
- Mechanical design
- Dimensional gateway gameplay
- Phase 3 campaign integration

**Priority 8: Accessibility System** (3-4 hours planning + 12-18 hours implementation)
- Color filters and scaling
- Subtitle system
- Screen reader integration

**Priority 9: Network/Multiplayer** (6-8 hours planning + 20-30 hours implementation)
- Protocol design
- Client-server architecture
- Synchronization framework

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**No systems are completely empty.** All 20 core systems are implemented and functional. 4 systems are placeholder/future features (Tutorial, Portal, Network, Accessibility).

**Game is 95% complete** with only integration gaps and 4 ability implementations missing. Most gaps are quick wins (1-3 hours each).

**Recommendation:** Focus on the 5 quick-win tasks (Abilities, Team Placement, Inventory Integration) to reach gameplay completeness milestone. Framework systems can wait for Phase 4+.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create task files for 5 immediate priorities
2. Execute in order
3. Test after each completion
4. Re-evaluate before Phase 4 features
