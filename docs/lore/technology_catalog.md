## Overview

The Technology Catalog represents humanity's technological evolution across four phases of the AlienFall campaign (1996-2004). Each phase introduces new weapon systems, armor improvements, and vehicles as humanity responds to escalating alien threats and discovers new technologies through battlefield salvage and research.

### Key Principles

1. **Linear Progression:** Technology advances sequentially (Ballistic → Laser → Plasma → Particle Beam)
2. **Material Gating:** Access to advanced tech restricted by material scarcity
3. **Research Requirements:** Most tech requires prerequisite research before manufacturing
4. **Phase-Based Availability:** Tech locked to specific phases (can't access Phase 2 weapons during Phase 0)
5. **Balanced Progression:** Each phase achieves rough parity with current alien threat level

### Technology Categories

- **Weapons** - Infantry firearms and heavy weapons
- **Armor** - Personal protective equipment
- **Equipment** - Grenades, medical kits, utility items
- **Vehicles** - Craft, submarines, interceptors
- **Facilities** - Base structures for research/manufacturing

```

### Technology Equivalence (Rough Combat Power)

At any given phase, multiple weapon types roughly equivalent in power:

**Phase 1 Balance Example:**
- Plasma Rifle (alien, 45 damage) ≈ Laser Rifle (human, 35 damage) + 10 experience bonus

**Phase 2 Balance Example:**
- Gauss Rifle (48 damage, high penetration) ≈ Sonic Rifle (40 damage, crowd control) ≈ Plasma Rifle (45 damage, alien legacy)

**Phase 3 Imbalance:**
- Vortex Cannon (80 damage, singularity) >> Particle Beam Rifle (60 damage) > Hybrid Plasma Cannon (75 damage)
- **Note:** Vortex is MOST expensive to manufacture, representing resource scarcity trade-off

---

## Material Requirements

### Phase 0: No Exotic Materials

All Phase 0 weapons use conventional manufacturing inputs:
- Steel, copper, electronics
- No special research prerequisites (except Heavy Weapons)
- Cost: 50-1200 credits per weapon

### Phase 1: Elerium-115 Introduction

**Elerium-115:** Alien power source from crashed UFOs and alien corpses

**Requirements:**
- Laser weapons: No elerium (pure energy from facilities)
- Plasma weapons: 2-3 elerium per weapon (manufacturing bottleneck)
- Typical UFO crash yields: 5-10 elerium

**Scarcity:** Moderate (mid-Phase 1, becomes abundant by Phase 1 end)

### Phase 2: Diverse Materials

| Material | Source | Use | Quantity/Weapon |
|----------|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Elerium-115** | UFOs, Aliens | Plasma weapons | 2-3 per weapon |
| **Alien Alloys** | Crashed UFOs | Armor upgrades | 3-5 per suit |
| **Sonar Cores** | Aquatic aliens | Submarine tech | 1 per submarine |
| **Exotic Aquatic Materials** | USO wreckage | Hybrid weapons | 2-3 per unit |

**Scarcity:** Moderate-High (supply dependent on mission success)

### Phase 3: Dimensional Exotics

| Material | Source | Use | Rarity |
|----------|--------|-----|--------|
| **Quantum Crystals** | Dimensional breaches | Dimensional weapons | Very Rare |
| **Exotic Dusts** | Dimensional zones | Armor enhancement | Rare |
| **Dimensional Cores** | Nexus areas | Vortex ammunition | Ultra-Rare |
| **Consciousness Matrices** | Ethereal corpses | Consciousness tech | Ultra-Rare (3-5 per entire campaign) |

**Strategy:** Phase 3 manufacturing heavily gated by material scarcity. Vortex weapons require resources equivalent to 10-15 plasma rifles.

**Early Phase 1:** Elerium scarcity limits plasma production
**Mid Phase 2:** Submarine construction requires rare sonar cores
**Late Phase 3:** Dimensional material scarcity prevents mass vortex manufacturing

## Best Practices

### Technology Selection Strategy

#### Phase 0: Use What You Have
- Stick with ballistic weapons (only option)
- Upgrade armor as credits allow
- Focus on completing early missions to gather resources

#### Phase 1: Adapt as Tech Appears
- Switch to laser when available (more efficient)
- Use plasma for heavy targets (higher damage, but elerium-limited)
- Balance weapon types based on mission threats

**Optimal Phase 1 Squad:**
- 4 Plasma Rifles (heavy hitters) + 4 Laser Rifles (efficiency) + 4 Ballistic Rifles (backup)

#### Phase 2: Specialization by Threat
- **Ground vs Terrestrial Aliens:** Use Plasma or Gauss (high penetration)
- **Aquatic Threats:** Use Sonic (effective vs organic armor)
- **Heavy Armor:** Use Gauss (best armor penetration)

**Optimal Phase 2 Squad:**
- 4 Gauss Rifles (armor penetration) + 4 Sonic Rifles (organic targets) + 2 Magna-Plasma (versatility) + 2 Ballistic (backup)

#### Phase 3: Overkill is Efficient
- Vortex weapons bypass almost all defenses
- Particle Beam offers better cost/efficiency than Vortex for routine combat
- Save Vortex for final Nexus battle

**Optimal Phase 3 Squad:**
- 8 Particle Beam Rifles (standard) + 4 Vortex Rifles (heavy) for endgame

### Resource Management

1. **Do NOT** over-manufacture Phase 0 weapons in Phase 1
2. **Prioritize** research over weapon manufacturing (research multiplies future efficiency)
3. **Stockpile** elerium when abundant (Phase 1 mid-game)
4. **Farm** dimensional materials late Phase 3 (need 20+ for full vortex squad)

### Technology Trading

Some human factions trade technology:
- **Black Market:** Sells captured alien weapons at premium prices
- **Syndicate:** Offers prototype weapons for high cost
- **GHOST:** Military prototypes available for faction favor

## Modding Guide

### Adding New Technology

#### 1. Create Weapon Definition in TOML

```toml
[[weapon]]
id = "custom_laser_rifle"
name = "Custom Laser Rifle v2"
phase = "phase1"
category = "laser_rifle"
type = "energy"
cost_manufacturing = 3000
research_required = ["research_custom_lasers"]
damage = 38
damage_type = "laser"
armor_penetration = 22
accuracy = 76
range = 32
fire_rate = 2
capacity = 30
weight = 3.6
description = "Improved laser rifle with enhanced capacitor bank."
```

#### 2. Create Research Definition

```toml
[[research]]
id = "research_custom_lasers"
name = "Custom Laser Improvements"
phase = "phase1"
category = "weapons"
description = "Enhanced laser rifle design with improved efficiency."
prerequisites = ["research_laser_technology"]
unlock_items = ["custom_laser_rifle"]
research_cost = 1500
research_time_days = 12
```

#### 3. Update `docs/lore/technology_catalog.md`

Add entry to appropriate phase section with stats and research chain.

#### 4. Test

Run game, verify:
- Research appears in tech tree
- Weapon can be manufactured after research
- Stats are correct in-game

### Tech Level Field Values

Use these standardized tech_level values:

- `"ballistic"` - Conventional firearms
- `"laser"` - Human laser weapons
- `"plasma"` - Alien plasma (captured/adapted)
- `"psionic"` - Psionic amplifiers
- `"gauss"` - Electromagnetic rail weapons
- `"sonic"` - Vibration-based weapons
- `"aquatic"` - Aquatic-specific tech
- `"particle"` - Particle beam (Phase 3)
- `"vortex"` - Vortex/singularity (Phase 3)
- `"dimensional"` - Dimensional phase tech (Phase 3)

### Adding New Armor

```toml
[[armor]]
id = "custom_tactical_suit"
name = "Custom Tactical Suit"
phase = "phase2"
category = "tactical"
armor_class = 2
armor_protection = 38
weight = 8
cost_manufacturing = 2200
research_required = ["research_tactical_innovations"]
special_abilities = ["camouflage", "enhanced_agility"]
description = "Specialized tactical armor with integrated stealth systems."
```

### Adding New Vehicles

```toml
[[vehicle]]
id = "custom_fighter_jet"
name = "Custom Fighter Jet"
phase = "phase3"
category = "interceptor"
type = "air"
speed = 28
range = 55
armor = 38
health = 240
capacity = 4
cost_manufacturing = 14000
research_required = ["research_custom_interceptors"]
special_abilities = ["hypersonic_boost", "evasion_matrix"]
description = "Advanced fighter design combining human and alien aerodynamics."
```

### Modding Tips

1. **Balance is important** - New weapons should fit tech tier (don't make Phase 0 weapon too powerful)
2. **Prerequisites matter** - New tech should require appropriate prerequisite research
3. **Material costs** - Balance cost vs power (expensive weapons should be better)
4. **Description matters** - Good descriptions help players understand tech progression
5. **Phase consistency** - New weapons should make sense in assigned phase

## Conclusion

The Technology Catalog represents humanity's evolution from conventional baseline through captured alien tech to ultimate dimensional weapons. Each technology choice reflects strategic decisions about resource allocation, specialization, and risk tolerance. Mastery of the tech system is essential to successful campaign completion.

**Key Takeaway:** Technology is not just power - it's a reflection of humanity's learning and adaptation to existential threats.
