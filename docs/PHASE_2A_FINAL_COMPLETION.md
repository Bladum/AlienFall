## Tactical Bonus Implementation

### Example 1: Front Attack (No Bonus)

```
Attack from directly in front:
Base damage: 40
Flanking multiplier: 1.0
Cover: Full (1.0)
Cover multiplier: 1.0 (full protection)
Cover reduction: 1.0 × 1.0 = 1.0
Final damage: 40 × 1.0 × (1 - 1.0) = 0 (fully blocked)
Morale damage: 0% (no penalty)
```

### Example 2: Side Attack (Flanking Bonus)

```
Attack from side position:
Base damage: 40
Flanking multiplier: 1.25
Cover: Full (1.0)
Cover multiplier: 0.5 (half protection)
Cover reduction: 1.0 × 0.5 = 0.5
Final damage: 40 × 1.25 × (1 - 0.5) = 25 (half gets through)
Morale damage: +15% (additional penalty)
Accuracy: +10% bonus
```

### Example 3: Rear Attack (Full Bonus)

```
Attack from rear position:
Base damage: 40
Flanking multiplier: 1.5
Cover: Full (1.0)
Cover multiplier: 0.0 (no protection)
Cover reduction: 1.0 × 0.0 = 0.0
Final damage: 40 × 1.5 × (1 - 0.0) = 60 (full damage)
Morale damage: +30% (severe psychological impact)
Accuracy: +25% bonus
```
