## 📊 ANALYSIS COMPLETED

### ✅ Engine Structure Analyzed
- 443 Lua files catalogued
- 17 major subsystems analyzed
- Empty folders identified (13+)
- File distribution mapped
- Naming inconsistencies found

### ✅ Duplicates Identified & Decided
- 27 duplicate file groups found
- Decisions made for EACH:
  - 18 files to DELETE
  - 4 files to RENAME
  - 5 files to KEEP BOTH (intentional)
- No ambiguity - every decision documented with rationale

### ✅ Subsystems Analyzed
- **Geoscape:** 24 root files (chaos) → 7 organized folders
- **Battlescape:** Over-nested structure → flattened & clear
- **Basescape:** 1 file (empty) → complete system structure
- **Economy:** 1 file (empty) → organized with systems
- **Core:** 15 mixed files → 7 concerned-separated folders
- **Politics:** Scattered → organized
- **Content/Lore:** Duplicated → consolidated
- **AI, GUI, Analytics, etc.:** All mapped

### ✅ Problems Documented
- 27 duplicate files causing confusion
- 24 geoscape files at root (no organization)
- Basescape severely underdeveloped
- Core systems mixed without concerns
- API doesn't match engine
- Naming conventions inconsistent
- Empty folders everywhere
- 13+ nested levels in some systems

### ✅ Solutions Provided
- New folder structure for each system
- Consolidation plan for duplicates
- Renaming strategy for conflicts
- Separation of concerns in core
- API-to-engine mapping
- Consistent naming guidelines
- Clear file organization
