- Can extend to higher ground bonus

### 2. Threat Assessment
- Weighted 4-factor model
- Damage potential (50%) - player will take hit
- Position advantage (30%) - tactical situation
- Range (10%) - accuracy consideration
- Weapon vs armor (10%) - type effectiveness
- Total: 0-100 scale, clear priority

### 3. AI Planning
- Mission scoring pre-filters options
- Multi-turn planning sets direction
- Squad leaders coordinate tactics
- Resource awareness enforces constraints

### 4. Finance System
- Relations as multiplier (not absolute)
