## Detailed Analysis

### ✅ Fuel Consumption Mechanics

**Validation Results**:
- Base fuel consumption: 5% per movement leg
- Fuel calculation: `movement_distance × 0.05`
- Tank capacity varies by craft size:
  - Small craft: 100 units (20 legs)
  - Medium craft: 200 units (40 legs)
  - Large craft: 300 units (60 legs)
- Refueling at bases: Automatic (0 cost in home base)
- Emergency refuel: Black market access required

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All calculations correct

---

### ✅ Travel Time Calculation

**Validation Results**:
- Base travel speed: 1 province per day
- Speed modifier by craft:
  - Small/Scout: 1.5× speed (+50%)
  - Medium/Transport: 1.0× speed (baseline)
  - Large/Capital: 0.75× speed (-25%)
- Weather effects: Up to ±1 day
- Calendar properly tracked
- Day/night cycle affects visibility but not speed

**Example**:
```
Scout craft traveling 3 provinces = 3 days / 1.5 = 2 days
Transport craft traveling 3 provinces = 3 days / 1.0 = 3 days
Capital craft traveling 3 provinces = 3 days / 0.75 = 4 days
```

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All calculations correct

---

### ✅ Interception Mechanics

**Validation Results**:
- Interception chance calculated based on:
  - UFO detection radius (500-1000km)
  - Craft visibility (size-based)
  - Radar coverage (region-based)
  - Time of day (better at night for UFOs)
- Interception probability: 5-25% per day of travel
- When triggered:
  1. Player notified of interception
  2. Combat options presented
  3. Battlescape engagement or evasion possible
  4. Outcome affects craft status

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All mechanics working

---

### ✅ En-Route Events

**Validation Results**:
- Event types implemented:
  1. Weather systems (10% chance)
  2. UFO encounters (15% chance)
  3. Emergency repairs needed (5% chance)
  4. Discovery of anomalies (8% chance)
  5. Religious/morale events (5% chance)

- Event handling:
  - Weather: Add 1-2 days to travel
  - UFO: Trigger interception system
  - Repairs: Craft damaged but continues
  - Discovery: Unlock new mission types
  - Morale: Affect unit sanity/morale

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All events functional

---

### ✅ Multi-Leg Journey Support

**Validation Results**:
- Waypoint system functional
- Route planning working
- Intermediate stops properly handled
- Refueling at way stations operational
- Re-supply during journey working
- Event tracking across legs correct

**Example Route**:
```
Base A → Province B (2 days, 10 fuel)
         ↓ Refuel
Province B → Province C (3 days, 15 fuel)
             ↓ Storm event (add 1 day)
Province C → Destination (1 day, 5 fuel)
Total: 7 days, 30 fuel
```

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Multi-leg journeys working perfectly
