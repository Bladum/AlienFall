# Crafts API Reference

**System:** Strategic Layer (Interception & Travel)
**Module:** `engine/geoscape/`
**Latest Update:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

The Crafts system manages player-controlled aircraft and spacecraft for interception, transport, reconnaissance, and combat. Crafts travel between provinces on the geoscape, engage in tactical interception combat, and serve as persistent strategic assets. Each craft has health, fuel, crew, weapons, equipment, and experience that persist across missions.

**Layer Classification:** Strategic / Asset Management
**Primary Responsibility:** Spacecraft lifecycle, movement, equipment, combat, experience progression
**Integration Points:** Geoscape (movement), Basescape (storage/repair), Interception (combat), Battlescape (unit deployment), Research (technology availability)

**Key Features:**
- Multiple craft types (transports, fighters, gunships)
- Movement across geoscape with fuel consumption
- Equipment and weapon management
- Interception combat mechanics
- Damage and repair systems
- Crew management and capacity
- Experience progression and rank advancement
- Customization and addon system

-- Create new craft
local craft = CraftManager.createCraft("skyranger", "Skyranger-01", base)

-- Equip with weapons
local weapon = CraftWeapon.new("machine_gun")
craft:addWeapon(weapon)

-- Check readiness
if craft:isReadyForDeployment() then
  print("Craft ready to deploy")
else
  print("Craft needs repairs: " .. (craft.max_hp - craft.hp) .. " HP")
end

-- Deploy to mission
local can_deploy, reason = craft:canTravelTo(mission_province)
if can_deploy then
  craft:travelTo(mission_province)
  print("Craft deploying")
end
```

### Example 2: Travel Between Provinces

```lua
local craft = CraftSystem.getCraft("skyranger_01")
local currentProvince = geoscape:getProvinceAt(craft:getLocation())
local targetProvince = geoscape:getProvinceById("california")

-- Check if reachable
if craft:canReach(targetProvince:getCoordinates()) then
  -- Move craft
  craft:setLocation(targetProvince:getCoordinates())
  craft:consumeFuel(distance * craft_type.fuel_consumption)

  print("Craft moved to " .. targetProvince:getName())
else
  print("Out of range. Need to refuel.")
  craft:refuelFull()
end
```

### Example 3: Interception

```lua
local craft = CraftSystem.getCraft("lightning_01")
local ufo = GEOSystem.getDetectedUFO("ufo_01")

-- Check if can intercept
if craft:canReach(ufo:getLocation()) then
  -- Start interception
  local interception = craft:startInterception(ufo)

  -- Battle resolves via Interception system
  print("Interception started!")
end
```

### Example 4: Process Combat and Experience

```lua
-- Engage UFO in interception
local result = CraftCombat.resolveInterception(craft, ufo)

if result == "victory" then
  craft:gainExperience(100)
  craft:recordKill("ufo")

  -- Check for rank-up
  if CraftCombat.processRankUp(craft) then
    print("Craft promoted to Rank " .. craft:getRank())
  end
else
  -- Took damage
  local damage_taken = ufo.firepower - craft.armor_class
  craft:takeDamage(damage_taken)
  print("Craft damaged. Health: " .. craft.hp .. "/" .. craft.max_hp)
end
```

### Example 5: Maintenance and Refueling

```lua
-- Check craft status
local fuel_percent = craft:getFuelPercent()
local health_percent = craft:getHealthPercent()

if fuel_percent < 0.3 then
  print("Low fuel - returning to base")
  local turns_to_return = CraftMovement.calculateTravelTime(craft, craft.current_location, base.location)
  CraftMovement.returnCraft(craft, base)
end

if health_percent < 0.5 then
  print("Significant damage - requesting repair")
  CraftMaintenance.autoRepair(craft)
end
```

### Example 6: Install Upgrades

```lua
-- Unlock stealth addon through research
local addon = CraftAddon.new("stealth_generator")

if CraftMaintenance.installAddon(craft, addon) then
  print("Stealth generator installed")
  print("Detection difficulty increased by 50%")
else
  print("Cannot install: insufficient research or incompatible craft")
end
```

### Example 7: Fleet Management

```lua
local base = BaseSystem.getBase("main_base")
local allCrafts = CraftSystem.getCraftsByBase(base)

-- Check all ready
local readyCount = 0
for _, craft in ipairs(allCrafts) do
  if craft:isOperational() then
    readyCount = readyCount + 1
  else
    print(craft:getName() .. " status: " .. craft:getStatus())
  end
end

print("Ready crafts: " .. readyCount .. "/" .. #allCrafts)
```

## Pilot Skill Effects

### Pilot System Overview

Pilots are specialized aircraft operators that provide bonuses to craft performance based on their rank and individual stats. The bonus system is **stat-based** rather than skill-based, allowing pilots to contribute across multiple craft attributes through their core aviation stats.

### Pilot Rank System

Pilots progress through **3 ranks** gained by accumulating experience points during interception missions:

| Rank | Title | XP Required | Bonuses | Insignia |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 0 | **Rookie** | 0 | None | - |
| 1 | **Veteran** | 100 | +1 SPEED, +2 AIM, +1 REACTION | Silver |
| 2 | **Ace** | 300 (cumulative) | +2 SPEED, +4 AIM, +2 REACTION | Gold |

**Rank Progression Example:**
- New pilot recruits at Rank 0 (Rookie)
- After 100 XP from 3-4 interception victories → Rank 1 (Veteran)
- After 200+ more XP → Rank 2 (Ace)
- Rank bonuses are cumulative (Ace has all Veteran bonuses + additional)

### Pilot Bonus Calculation

Pilot bonuses are calculated from **individual pilot stats** using the formula:

```lua
-- Stat-to-bonus formula
bonus_percent = (pilot_stat - 5) / 100

-- Applied to craft attributes:
craft.speed = craft.base_speed * (1 + bonus_percent)
craft.accuracy = craft.base_accuracy * (1 + bonus_percent_aim)
craft.damage = craft.base_damage * (1 + bonus_percent_strength)
craft.reaction = craft.base_reaction * (1 + bonus_percent_reaction)
craft.radar_range = craft.base_radar + (bonus_percent_wisdom * 5)
craft.psi_defense = craft.base_psi_def * (1 + bonus_percent_psi)
```

### Multi-Pilot Stacking

Crafts with multiple pilot slots (e.g., Avenger with 2 pilots) benefit from stacking bonuses with **diminishing returns**:

```
First Pilot:  100% of calculated bonus
Second Pilot: 75% of calculated bonus
Third Pilot:  50% of calculated bonus (if supported)

Example: 2 Ace pilots with SPEED 10
- Pilot 1: (10-5)/100 = 5% speed bonus
- Pilot 2: (10-5)/100 * 0.75 = 3.75% speed bonus
- Total: 8.75% speed bonus to craft
```

### Pilot Stat Mapping

Each pilot stat maps to specific craft attributes:

| Pilot Stat | Craft Attribute | Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **SPEED** | Craft Speed | Flight velocity, engagement speed |
| **AIM** | Weapon Accuracy | Craft weapon hit chance |
| **REACTION** | Dodge/Evasion | Dodge incoming fire |
| **STRENGTH** | Damage Output | Weapon damage per shot |
| **ENERGY** | Fuel Efficiency | Range extension (lower consumption) |
| **WISDOM** | Radar Range | Detection distance bonus |
| **PSI** | Psi Defense | Resistance to psychic attacks |

### Pilot Requirements and Craft Assignments

Each craft type requires specific pilot capabilities and has limited pilot slots. Pilots must meet minimum requirements to be assigned to a craft.

**Craft Capacity System (3-Tier Distribution):**

Each craft has three capacity categories:
- **Pilots**: Flight crew slots (1-2 pilots per craft)
- **Crew**: Combat troops/passengers (1-10 soldiers/scientists)
- **Cargo**: Equipment storage (10-100 kg capacity)

**Example Capacity Configurations:**

```toml
# Lightning Interceptor - Single pilot fighter
[[craft_type]]
name = "Lightning"
capacity_pilots = 1              # 1 pilot required
capacity_crew = 0                # No additional crew
capacity_cargo = 5               # Minimal cargo (5kg)
pilot_class_required = "pilot"   # Any pilot acceptable
pilot_class_preferred = "fighter_pilot"  # Fighter Pilot preferred

# Skyranger - Transport with single pilot
[[craft_type]]
name = "Skyranger"
capacity_pilots = 1
capacity_crew = 6
capacity_cargo = 50
pilot_class_required = "pilot"
pilot_class_preferred = "helicopter_pilot"

# Avenger - Heavy bomber with 2 pilots
[[craft_type]]
name = "Avenger"
capacity_pilots = 2              # 2 pilots for better bonuses
capacity_crew = 10               # Full combat team
capacity_cargo = 100             # Full cargo hold
pilot_class_required = "pilot"
pilot_class_preferred = "bomber_pilot"
pilot_minimum_rank = 1           # Requires Veteran or higher
```

**Pilot Class Specializations:**

| Class | Best For | Stats Focus | Default Bonus |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **PILOT** (Base) | General operations | Balanced | Baseline bonuses only |
| **FIGHTER_PILOT** | Interceptor craft | +AIM, +REACTION | +10% accuracy in combat |
| **BOMBER_PILOT** | Heavy craft | +STRENGTH, +ENERGY | +15% damage, improved fuel |
| **HELICOPTER_PILOT** | Transport/VTOL | +WISDOM, +REACTION | +20% radar range, quick response |

**Assignment Rules:**

1. **Minimum Pilots**: Craft cannot operate without minimum pilot count
   - Lightning: Requires 1 pilot minimum
   - Avenger: Requires 2 pilots minimum (bonus from 2nd pilot reduces stacking penalty)

2. **Rank Requirements**: Some crafts require minimum pilot rank
   - Avenger requires Veteran rank (100+ XP)
   - Other crafts accept Rookie pilots

3. **Class Preference**: Assignment interface shows recommended classes
   - Assigning preferred class gives +5% morale bonus
   - Assigning mismatched class shows warning (still allowed)

4. **Craft Bonuses**: Applied only when all required pilots assigned
   - Empty pilot slots = no bonuses applied
   - Partial assignment (1 of 2 slots filled on Avenger) = only that pilot's bonuses

**Pilot Assignment Example:**

```lua
-- Avenger with 2 pilots
local avenger = Craft:new("avenger_01")
local pilot1 = Pilot:new("pilot_veteran_01", "BOMBER_PILOT", 1)  -- Veteran rank
local pilot2 = Pilot:new("pilot_ace_01", "BOMBER_PILOT", 2)     -- Ace rank

-- Calculate stacking bonuses
local bonus_total = CraftPilotSystem.calculateCombinedBonuses(avenger, {pilot1, pilot2})
-- pilot1 contributes 100% of bonuses
-- pilot2 contributes 75% of bonuses
-- Result: Enhanced Avenger with combined pilot benefits
```

---

## Fuel System Details

**Range Calculation:**
```
Range (km) = (Fuel Capacity / Consumption per 100km) * 100
Example: (5000L / 15L per hex) * 500 km/hex = 166,667 km range
```

**Consumption Formula:**
```
Fuel Used = Distance (hex) × Consumption Rate (L/hex)
Example: 10 hex × 15 L/hex = 150 liters used
```

**Low Fuel Thresholds:**
- Yellow: < 50% capacity (requires refuel planning)
- Red: < 25% capacity (must refuel immediately)
- Critical: < 10% capacity (cannot reach base, emergency landing)

---

## Status States

| Status | Meaning | Can Fly? | Can Refuel? |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| ready | Operational at base | Yes | Yes |
| flying | En route | No | No |
| damaged | Needs repair | No (if > 50% damage) | Yes |
| refueling | At fuel depot | No | In progress |
| maintenance | In hangar | No | No |
| deployed | On mission | No | No |
| destroyed | Destroyed in combat | No | No |

---

## Integration Points

**Inputs from:**
- Geoscape (movement calculations, deployment requests)
- Basescape (storage, repair facilities, fuel)
- Interception (combat engagement)
- Research (technology unlocks)

**Outputs to:**
- Geoscape (craft position, availability)

## Error Handling

```lua
-- Insufficient fuel
if not craft:canTravelTo(destination) then
  local fuel_needed = CraftMovement.calculateFuelCost(craft, distance)
  local fuel_available = craft.fuel
  print("Insufficient fuel: need " .. fuel_needed .. ", have " .. fuel_available)
end

-- Craft damaged
if craft:getHealthPercent() < 0.3 then
  print("Craft severely damaged - cannot deploy")
end

-- No weapons equipped
if #craft:getWeapons() == 0 then
  print("No weapons equipped - cannot engage in interception")
end

-- Incompatible addon
if not CraftMaintenance.installAddon(craft, addon) then
  print("Cannot install addon: " .. addon.id)
end

-- Out of range
if not craft:canReach(destination_hex) then
  print("Destination out of range")
  print("Maximum range: " .. craft:getMovementRange() .. " hexes")
end
```

### Speed Calculations

**Cruise Speed Optimization:**
```lua
function calculateOptimalSpeed(craft, destination_distance, time_available)
  -- Optimal speed balances time and fuel consumption

  -- Calculate distance constraint
  local speed_for_time = destination_distance / time_available

  -- Calculate fuel constraint
  -- At cruise speed: time = distance / speed
  -- Fuel = (fuel_rate_cruise * time)
  local max_distance_on_fuel = (craft.fuel_current / craft.fuel_consumption_cruise) * craft.speed_cruise

  -- Find optimal speed that satisfies both constraints
  local optimal_speed = math.min(
    speed_for_time,           -- Don't exceed time requirement
    craft.speed_max,          -- Don't exceed max speed
    max_distance_on_fuel / (destination_distance / craft.speed_cruise)  -- Fuel constraint
  )

  return math.clamp(optimal_speed, craft.speed_min_sustainable, craft.speed_max)
end

function calculateSpeedWithUpgrades(base_speed, upgrade_level)
  -- Each upgrade increases speed by 15%
  local speed_multiplier = 1.0 + (upgrade_level * 0.15)
  return base_speed * speed_multiplier
end

function calculateSpeedWithWeight(base_speed, cargo_weight)
  -- Excess weight reduces speed (weight penalty)
  local max_cargo = craft.weight_capacity or 5000
  local weight_ratio = cargo_weight / max_cargo

  if weight_ratio > 1.0 then
    -- Overweight significantly reduces speed
    local speed_penalty = 1.0 - ((weight_ratio - 1.0) * 0.5)  -- 50% reduction per unit over
    return base_speed * speed_penalty
  end

  return base_speed
end
```

### Fuel Consumption Mechanics

**Dynamic Fuel Consumption:**
```lua
function calculateFuelConsumption(craft, speed, altitude, environmental_factors)
  local base_consumption = craft.fuel_consumption_cruise

  -- Speed affects consumption (cubic relationship for realism)
  -- Fuel_consumption = base * (speed / cruise_speed)^2
  local speed_ratio = speed / craft.speed_cruise
  local speed_multiplier = speed_ratio * speed_ratio

  -- Altitude affects consumption (thinner air = better fuel economy)
  local altitude_factor = 1.0
  if craft.altitude_current < 3000 then
    altitude_factor = altitude_factor * 1.3  -- Dense air = higher consumption
  elseif craft.altitude_current > 8000 then
    altitude_factor = altitude_factor * 0.8  -- Thin air = better consumption
  end

  -- Environmental factors
  local weather_factor = environmental_factors.wind_resistance or 1.0
  local storm_factor = environmental_factors.storm_severity or 1.0

  -- Efficiency upgrades reduce consumption (10% per tier)
  local efficiency_multiplier = 1.0 - (craft.fuel_efficiency_upgrades * 0.1)

  local total_consumption = base_consumption *
                            speed_multiplier *
                            altitude_factor *
                            weather_factor *
                            (1.0 + storm_factor * 0.2) *
                            efficiency_multiplier

  return total_consumption
end

function getFlightTime(craft, distance, speed)
  -- Distance = Speed × Time → Time = Distance / Speed
  local time_hours = distance / speed

  -- Calculate fuel consumption for this flight
  local total_consumption = calculateFuelConsumption(craft, speed, craft.altitude_current, {})
  local fuel_needed = total_consumption * time_hours

  -- Check if craft has enough fuel
  if fuel_needed > craft.fuel_current then
    -- Not enough fuel - calculate how far we can go
    local max_time = craft.fuel_current / total_consumption
    local max_distance = speed * max_time

    return {
      possible = false,

  }
end
```

### Range Calculations

**Maximum Range by Fuel:**
```lua
function calculateMaxRange(craft)
  -- Based on cruise speed and fuel capacity
  local time_available_hours = craft.fuel_capacity / craft.fuel_consumption_cruise
  local max_range = craft.speed_cruise * time_available_hours

  return math.min(max_range, craft.range_max)  -- Cap at max range
end

function calculateRangeWithUpgrades(base_range, fuel_upgrade_level, efficiency_upgrade_level)
  -- Fuel capacity upgrades: +2000 fuel per level
  local fuel_bonus = 1.0 + (fuel_upgrade_level * 0.2)  -- +20% range per level

  -- Efficiency upgrades: -10% consumption per level = more range
  local efficiency_bonus = 1.0 + (efficiency_upgrade_level * 0.15)  -- +15% range per level

  local upgraded_range = base_range * fuel_bonus * efficiency_bonus

  return upgraded_range
end

function isDestinationInRange(craft, destination_hex, current_hex)
  -- Calculate distance in km
  local distance = calculateHexDistance(current_hex, destination_hex) * HEX_SIZE_KM

  -- Get maximum range at current fuel
  local current_max_range = (craft.fuel_current / craft.fuel_consumption_cruise) * craft.speed_cruise

  return distance <= current_max_range
end
```

### Damage & Fuel System Interaction

**Fuel Tank Integrity:**
```lua
function calculateFuelLeakRate(craft, damage_level)
  -- Damage to fuel systems increases consumption
  if damage_level < 0.2 then
    return 0.0  -- No leak
  elseif damage_level < 0.5 then
    return craft.fuel_consumption_cruise * 0.2  -- 20% leak
  elseif damage_level < 0.8 then
    return craft.fuel_consumption_cruise * 0.5  -- 50% leak
  else
    return craft.fuel_consumption_cruise * 1.0  -- 100% leak (catastrophic)
  end
end

function canReachDestinationWithDamage(craft, destination_distance, damage_level)
  -- Calculate fuel consumption with damage
  local base_consumption = calculateFuelConsumption(craft, craft.speed_cruise, 0, {})
  local leak_rate = calculateFuelLeakRate(craft, damage_level)
  local total_rate = base_consumption + leak_rate

  -- Calculate time needed
  local time_needed = destination_distance / craft.speed_cruise

  -- Calculate fuel needed
  local fuel_needed = total_rate * time_needed

  return craft.fuel_current >= fuel_needed
end
```

### Emergency Landing & Safety

**Low Fuel Warning System:**
```lua
function getFuelStatus(craft)
  local fuel_percent = (craft.fuel_current / craft.fuel_capacity) * 100

  if fuel_percent < 5 then
    return {status = "critical", message = "CRITICAL: Emergency landing required immediately"}
  elseif fuel_percent < 15 then
    return {status = "warning", message = "WARNING: Low fuel - returning to base required"}
  elseif fuel_percent < 30 then
    return {status = "caution", message = "CAUTION: Fuel running low - plan return"}
  else
    return {status = "normal", message = "Fuel status normal"}
  end
end

function calculateEmergencyLandingDistance(craft)
  -- Distance craft can travel at minimum speed before emergency landing required
  -- Uses 5% fuel reserve for safety
  local safe_fuel = craft.fuel_current * 0.95
  local time_available = safe_fuel / craft.fuel_consumption_cruise

  return craft.speed_cruise * time_available
end
```

### Refueling & Maintenance

**Refuel Time Calculation:**
```lua
function calculateRefuelTime(current_fuel, target_fuel, refuel_rate)
  -- refuel_rate in fuel units per hour
  local fuel_needed = target_fuel - current_fuel

  if fuel_needed <= 0 then
    return 0  -- Already at or above target
  end

  return fuel_needed / refuel_rate
end

function getRefuelCost(fuel_amount, fuel_price_per_unit)
  -- Base cost of fuel
  local base_cost = fuel_amount * fuel_price_per_unit

  -- Premium for emergency refueling (higher cost from remote bases)
  local premium_multiplier = 1.5  -- 50% markup

  return base_cost * premium_multiplier
