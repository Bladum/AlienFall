## Data Lifecycle and Quality

Ingestion → normalization → consolidation → publish, with profiling, drift detection, and lineage capture. Quality hooks run per stage, and lineage tables record dependencies.

```

### ELT Process Flow
- **Extract**: Data sourced from APIs, local files, or remote systems. Loaded into pandas DataFrames for initial processing. Converted to Parquet format in RAW zone
- **Transform**: Raw data cleaned and deduplicated. Timestamps added for incremental tracking. Transformed data moved to STAGE (temporary) then PROD (optimized)
- **Load**: SQL logic executed via playbooks. Indicator components (symptoms, trends, actions, analytics) saved as separate Parquet files in MASTER zone
- **Registration**: Views automatically registered over Parquet files. Combined PROD/MASTER schema creates unified data lake for querying

### Detailed Lifecycle Steps
- **Ingestion**: Data pulled from sources into RAW Parquet, supporting incremental loads and error handling
- **Normalization**: Data cleaned, transformed, validated in STAGE, with type fixes, null handling, enrichment
- **Consolidation**: STAGE data aggregated and enriched to PROD, creating optimized views for analytics
- **Publish**: PROD views registered in DuckDB, with lineage captured for dependencies and audit trails

### Quality Processes
- **Profiling**: Statistical analysis for data quality, including distributions, outliers, completeness metrics
- **Drift Detection**: Monitoring for schema changes, data shifts, and anomalies over time
- **Lineage Capture**: Tracking data flow from source to report, enabling impact analysis and compliance
- **Quality Hooks**: Automated checks at each stage, configurable via YAML for custom rules

### Quality Gates
- Schema and nullability checks on STAGE and PROD: Ensure data types match expectations and handle missing values appropriately
- Unique keys and referential sanity for published views: Validate relationships, foreign keys, uniqueness constraints
- Trend and snapshot append-only guarantees: Prevent overwrites in historical data, ensuring data integrity
- Custom rules: From quality.yml, e.g., value ranges, format validations, business logic checks
- Performance checks: Query execution times within defined limits to ensure scalability

### Data Quality Measurement Patterns
Implement quality rules using SQL ratios and scoring for data completeness validation.

#### Quality Ratio Calculation
```sql
-- Calculate data quality score (0.1 for symptom, 0.2 for cause, 0.5 for resolution)
SELECT 
    TICKETID,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN SYMPTOM IS NULL OR SYMPTOM = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.1 END +
        CASE WHEN CAUSE IS NULL OR CAUSE = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.2 END +
        CASE WHEN RESOLUTION IS NULL OR RESOLUTION = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.5 END
    ) AS quality_ratio
FROM incident_table
GROUP BY TICKETID;
```

#### BIS Implementation Workflow
1. Load data into DuckDB using Mini BIS or direct CSV import
2. Create quality measurement table with ratio calculations
3. Export results for analysis and reporting
4. Use ratios to identify data completeness trends over time

#### Common Quality Checks
- Null value detection: `WHERE field IS NULL OR field = ''`
- Pattern validation: `WHERE field NOT LIKE '%expected_pattern%'`
- Range validation: `WHERE numeric_field < min_value OR numeric_field > max_value`
- Duplicate detection: `GROUP BY key_fields HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`

## DataOps Principles and Squad

**DataOps Overview**: DataOps combines lean manufacturing, agile culture, and data engineering to enable faster value generation from data. It applies DevOps principles to data pipelines, emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.

### Core DataOps Principles

| Principle | Description | BIS Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Establish measurements | Track progress and performance at every stage of the data flow, benchmark cycle times where possible | Quality gates, SLA tracking, lineage monitoring |
| Define semantic layer | Create rules for abstracted data definitions ensuring everyone speaks the same language | YAML configs, standardized schemas, API definitions |
| Validate with feedback | Include human feedback loops and "eyeball tests" for incremental validation and trust | Quality checks, manual validation steps, stakeholder reviews |
| Automate stages | Automate as many data flow stages as possible including BI, data science, and analytics | Pipeline automation, scheduled runs, auto-deployment |
| Optimize bottlenecks | Use performance benchmarks to identify and optimize bottlenecks through hardware or automation | Performance monitoring, query optimization, resource scaling |
| Establish governance | Focus on data ownership, transparency, and comprehensive lineage tracking | Role-based access, audit trails, comprehensive documentation |
| Design for growth | Ensure the data flow model accommodates increasing volume and variety affordably | Scalable architecture, cloud-native design, modular components |

### DataOps Squad Structure

| Lean Methodologies | PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act), value stream mapping, ROI tracking, Kaizen for continuous improvement | Continuous optimization |

---

## Dev Workflow and GitOps

**GitOps Philosophy**: GitOps treats Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application configuration. Everything is version-controlled, reviewed, and deployed through Git workflows.

### BIS GitOps Implementation
Everything is handled by Git: engine code, reports, jobs, documentation, formatting. Issues are linked to GitHub, product backlog and scrum ceremonies are managed via GitHub Projects.

| Component | Location | Purpose | GitOps Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Engine Code | `engine/src/` | Core Python modules and business logic | Version control, code review, automated testing |
| Reports/Jobs | `workspace/` | YAML configs for data pipelines and reports | Declarative configuration, change tracking |
| Documentation | `wiki/`, module READMEs | Project knowledge and API documentation | Living documentation, collaborative editing |
| Formatting | `workspace/*/formats.yml` | Excel styling and presentation configs | Consistent output formatting |
| Issues | GitHub Issues | Bug tracking, feature requests | Linked to PRs and branches for traceability |
| Product Backlog | GitHub Projects | Epic and story management | Integrated planning and execution |
| Scrum Process | Issues and Projects | Sprint planning and tracking | Transparent, auditable process |

### Practical GitOps Workflow Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/bis-ci-cd.yml
name: BIS CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Validate YAML configs
      run: |
        find workspace/ -name "*.yml" -exec python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('{}'))" \;
    
  test:
    needs: validate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
  
  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: echo "Deploying to staging environment"
  
  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: echo "Deploying to production environment"
```

```

### Best Practices
- **Work in small branches** with clear, focused scope
- **Open PRs** with descriptive titles and comprehensive descriptions
- **Preserve public contracts** to maintain API compatibility
- **Keep release notes** detailed and stakeholder-friendly
- **Record decisions as ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records)

### Definition of Done

| Category | Requirements | Validation Method |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Code Quality | Code and YAML validated, linted | Automated CI checks |
| Documentation | Docs and examples updated | Manual review, automated link checking |
| Testing | Tests or smoke scripts executed | Automated test suites |
| Change Management | Release notes and ADR updated if contracts changed | PR review checklist |
| Integration | End-to-end validation in test environment | Automated deployment pipeline |

### Playbook for Schema Changes
1. **Propose additive changes** - Backward compatibility maintained
2. **Include migration notes and tests** - Clear upgrade path documented
3. **Update family checks and quality rules** - Validation logic updated
4. **Validate in dev/test rings** - Multi-environment testing
5. **Gradual rollout** - Phased deployment with monitoring

---

## CI/CD and Environments

Environment matrix and promotion rules are maintained in release.yml. Packaging and scheduled jobs run with required checks for lint and validation.

| Env | Purpose | Data Policy | Promotion |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------|
| dev | rapid iteration, feature work | synthetic or limited real data | branch merge to mainline |
| test | validation and UAT | masked/approved datasets | tagged builds with checks |
| prod | customer delivery | governed real data | release per `release.yml` |

| **Trunk-Based** | Single trunk | Daily commits | Automated | Daily | Low |
| **Release Branch** | Main + release branches | Release-based | Comprehensive | Variable | Medium |

### Release Confidence
- Every release leaves the system better documented, easier to reason about, and more valuable

---

## Developer Toolchain

Recommended extensions: GitHub Copilot, Python, YAML, Markdown, Mermaid, GitLens, and a SQL extension. Tasks include launching the GUI from VS Code. Personas guide how to use AI safely; see Chatmodes.

### Task Launch
- Example: VS Code task "Run BIS GUI (VS Code Launch)" starts the GUI with the configured venv

### Experience Goals
- Onboard fast, iterate safely, and let the tools do the heavy lifting

---

## GitHub Actions and Automation

Workflows handle build, lint, and packaging; issues and PRs can be triaged by agents aligned to Planner, Janitor, and Knowledge Manager personas. Required checks must pass before merge.

### Automation Spirit
- Robots do the chores; humans do the judgment. Keep it that way

---

## Knowledge as Code and RAG

Docs, READMEs, and specs are curated for agents to consume locally, enabling offline or private RAG.

### Content Sources and Cadence
- **Sources**: wiki, module READMEs, workspace YAML, BIS API, architecture doc
- **Cadence**: update on release and when tenant specs materially change

---

## Observability and Reliability

Logging categories map to GUI tabs and background workers. Prioritize idempotency, retries, and fail-soft behavior. Metrics can be added incrementally.

### Categories
- GUI_* channels for per-tab logs
- Worker/Signals for background tasks
- Lineage tables for data dependencies

---

## Security and Compliance

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| PII leakage | Redact or avoid storing PII, limit logs |
| Outlook COM misuse | Windows-only guard and opt-in |
| Cross-tenant data access | Strict path isolation and checks |
| Secrets exposure | Use OS stores or secret managers; never commit secrets |

### Data lifecycle and quality
Ingestion → normalization → consolidation → publish, with profiling, drift detection, and lineage capture. Quality hooks run per stage, and lineage tables record dependencies.

**ELT Process Flow:**
- **Extract**: Data sourced from APIs, local files, or remote systems. Loaded into pandas DataFrames for initial processing. Converted to Parquet format in RAW zone.
- **Transform**: Raw data cleaned and deduplicated. Timestamps added for incremental tracking. Transformed data moved to STAGE (temporary) then PROD (optimized).
- **Load**: SQL logic executed via playbooks. Indicator components (symptoms, trends, actions, analytics) saved as separate Parquet files in MASTER zone.
- **Registration**: Views automatically registered over Parquet files. Combined PROD/MASTER schema creates unified data lake for querying.

Detailed Lifecycle Steps
- Ingestion: Data is pulled from sources like APIs, files, or databases into RAW Parquet, supporting incremental loads and error handling.
- Normalization: Data is cleaned, transformed, and validated in STAGE, with type fixes, null handling, and enrichment from external sources.
- Consolidation: STAGE data is aggregated and enriched to PROD, creating optimized views for analytics and reporting.
- Publish: PROD views are registered in DuckDB, with lineage captured for dependencies and audit trails.

Quality Processes
- Profiling: Statistical analysis for data quality, including distributions, outliers, and completeness metrics.
- Drift detection: Monitoring for schema changes, data shifts, and anomalies over time.
- Lineage capture: Tracking data flow from source to report, enabling impact analysis and compliance.
- Quality hooks: Automated checks at each stage, configurable via YAML for custom rules.

Quality gates
- Schema and nullability checks on STAGE and PROD: Ensure data types match expectations and handle missing values appropriately.
- Unique keys and referential sanity for published views: Validate relationships, foreign keys, and uniqueness constraints.
- Trend and snapshot append-only guarantees: Prevent overwrites in historical data, ensuring data integrity.
- Custom rules: From quality.yml, e.g., value ranges, format validations, and business logic checks.
- Performance checks: Query execution times within defined limits to ensure scalability.

**Data quality measurement patterns:**
Implement quality rules using SQL ratios and scoring for data completeness validation.

*Quality ratio calculation:*
```sql
-- Calculate data quality score (0.1 for symptom, 0.2 for cause, 0.5 for resolution)
SELECT 
    TICKETID,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN SYMPTOM IS NULL OR SYMPTOM = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.1 END +
        CASE WHEN CAUSE IS NULL OR CAUSE = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.2 END +
        CASE WHEN RESOLUTION IS NULL OR RESOLUTION = '' THEN 0 ELSE 0.5 END
    ) AS quality_ratio
FROM incident_table
GROUP BY TICKETID;
```

*BIS implementation workflow:*
1. Load data into DuckDB using Mini BIS or direct CSV import
2. Create quality measurement table with ratio calculations
3. Export results for analysis and reporting
4. Use ratios to identify data completeness trends over time

*Common quality checks:*
- Null value detection: `WHERE field IS NULL OR field = ''`
- Pattern validation: `WHERE field NOT LIKE '%expected_pattern%'`
- Range validation: `WHERE numeric_field < min_value OR numeric_field > max_value`
- Duplicate detection: `GROUP BY key_fields HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`

Operator confidence
- Quality gates fail fast with clear messages, stopping runs early on issues and providing actionable feedback.
- Lineage makes impact analysis and audits a breeze, tracing data from source to report for compliance.
- Idempotent operations ensure safe retries without side effects, maintaining system stability.
- Comprehensive logging provides detailed traces for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
