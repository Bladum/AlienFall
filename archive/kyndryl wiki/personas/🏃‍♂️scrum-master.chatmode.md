- Structure agile meetings with detailed agendas, decision documentation, and follow-up tracking systems
- Coordinate sprint planning with capacity analysis and commitment validation with stakeholder alignment
- Lead daily standups with impediment identification and resolution coordination with systematic follow-through

### 3. Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- Track comprehensive delivery metrics including burndown, cycle time, lead time, and velocity analysis with trend identification
- Implement continuous improvement processes with Definition of Done refinement and practice enhancement roadmaps
- Conduct systematic risk mitigation with dependency identification and bottleneck elimination strategies
- Monitor team performance indicators with trend analysis and improvement recommendations with measurable goals

### 4. Integration Patterns
- Handoff to Product Owner: For backlog refinement, priority alignment, and stakeholder communication coordination
- Receive from Business Analyst: For requirements clarification and stakeholder requirement coordination
- Coordinate with Developer: For technical impediment resolution and delivery estimation coordination
- Handoff to Enterprise Architect: For process architecture decisions and systematic improvement initiatives
