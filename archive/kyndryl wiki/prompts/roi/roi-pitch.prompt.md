- **Pitch Constraints**: Concise executive-ready materials (max 1000 words total, Executive Summary ‚â§200 words), persuasive visionary tone, focus on business outcomes over technical details

## Reasoning & Advanced Techniques
- **Required Reasoning Level**: Advanced - Employ step-by-step analysis and strategic thinking
- **Thinking Process Required**: Yes - Reason through customer problems, map BIS capabilities to solutions, calculate ROI impacts
- **Advanced Techniques**: Use business logic trees, outcome mapping, stakeholder analysis, competitive positioning
- **Security Practices**: Redact sensitive data (emails, tokens), use provided customer details only, flag PII detection
- **Idempotence**: Include marker (AUTOGENERATED_BUSINESS_PITCH v1) for safe re-runs, support dry-run and apply modes

## Code Block Guidelines
- Include Mermaid diagrams for process flows and architecture visualizations
- Use Markdown tables for ROI calculations, comparison matrices, and stakeholder maps
- Provide ASCII art or simple diagrams for quick conceptual illustrations

- **Apply changes**: Confirm output path (temp/pitch/output_pitch.md) and overwrite policy; then save exactly one file there
- Include the idempotence marker at the top of the output file: (AUTOGENERATED_BUSINESS_PITCH v1 ‚Äî safe to re-run)

## Output Envelopes (machine-parseable; always include all three blocks in this order)
- **BEGIN OUTPUT PITCH / END OUTPUT PITCH** ‚Äî contains the final Markdown pitch content only
