# BIS Best Practices Repository - Executive Summary

## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive best practices and guidelines for AI agents and developers working on the BIS (Business Intelligence System) project. The collection covers multiple domains essential for maintaining high-quality, secure, and efficient software development practices.

## Key Documents

### Domain-Specific Best Practices
- **Python Best Practices** ([best-practices_python.instructions.md](best-practices_python.instructions.md)): Comprehensive guidelines for Python development, covering code structure, security, performance, and testing standards specific to the BIS repository.
- **SQL Best Practices** ([best-practices_sql.instructions.md](best-practices_sql.instructions.md)): Detailed standards for DuckDB SQL development, including formatting, modeling, performance optimization, and data quality assurance.
- **AI Systems Best Practices** ([best-practices-ai-system.instructions.md](best-practices-ai-system.instructions.md)): Framework for building, deploying, and maintaining effective AI systems with agents, focusing on security, evaluation, and technical implementation.
- **Architecture Best Practices** ([best-practices-architecture.instructions.md](best-practices-architecture.instructions.md)): Standards for software architecture documentation, covering business-technology alignment, service integration, and implementation practices.
- **Business Analysis Best Practices** ([best-practices-business-analysis.instructions.md](best-practices-business-analysis.instructions.md)): Guidelines for business requirements gathering, stakeholder analysis, and quality assurance in business analysis processes.

### Template and System Framework
- **Practices System Template** ([practices-system.md](practices-system.md)): Reusable template for creating new domain-specific best practices guides, including AI agent workflow instructions and content validation checklists.
