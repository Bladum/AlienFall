## How to Run Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
# From project root
lovec tests/runners
```

```bash
# Unit tests
lovec tests/runners/run_all_tests.lua

# Specific test runner
lovec tests/runners/run_battlescape_test.lua
```

### Run in Lua (without Love2D)
```bash
lua tests/runners/run_all_tests.lua
```

## Test Output Format

All tests provide:
- ✓ Success indicators
- ✗ Failure indicators
- Error messages with context
- Performance metrics (for benchmarks)
- Summary statistics
- Exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)

## Mock Data Usage

All tests use centralized mock data from `mock/` directory:

```lua
local MockUnits = require("mock.units")
local MockItems = require("mock.items")
local MockFacilities = require("mock.facilities")
local MockEconomy = require("mock.economy")
local MockGeoscape = require("mock.geoscape")

-- Generate test data
local soldier = MockUnits.getSoldier("Test", "ASSAULT")
local weapon = MockItems.getWeapon("RIFLE")
local base = MockFacilities.getStarterBase()
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests for all major game systems
2. **Consistent Test Data** - Centralized mock generators
3. **Easy to Run** - Single command runs all tests
4. **Performance Tracking** - Benchmarks identify bottlenecks
5. **Regression Prevention** - Automated test suite catches breakages
6. **Documentation** - Tests serve as usage examples
7. **Maintainability** - Organized structure with clear separation
