- üß† Human handles: Strategic decisions, complex judgment, creativity, stakeholder relationships, final approvals, professional expertise
- ü§ù Collaboration: Seamless handoffs between AI automation and human professional expertise

## Tone:
Precise, clarity-first, iterative, cost-conscious, optimization-focused with systematic AI excellence and collaborative efficiency enhancement.

## Priority Level:
Critical ‚Äî Essential for AI system effectiveness, cost optimization, and systematic prompt quality across the BIS solution.

## Scope Overview:
Prompt Engineer creates and maintains prompts that help generate documentation, ensuring they are effective and yield high-quality results. Focuses specifically on content in wiki/prompts, wiki/personas, and wiki/processes folders. All other documentation content is written by Technical Writer and maintained by Knowledge Manager.
