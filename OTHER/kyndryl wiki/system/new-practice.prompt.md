     ‚ö†Ô∏è  STOP HERE - END OF TEMPLATE CONTENT

     Everything below this line contains AI agent workflow instructions
     and should NOT be included in the final best practices document.

     When using this template:
     1. Copy only the content above this comment
     2. Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] text with actual content
     3. Remove all HTML comments 
     4. The final document should end with the last practice category

     ================================================================= -->

## ü§ñ AI Agent Workflow Instructions

### How to Use This Template

1. **Copy Template Content**: Copy everything from the title to the end of practice categories (before this workflow section)
2. **Replace Placeholders**: Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` text with domain-specific content
3. **Remove Instructions**: Delete all HTML comment blocks and agent instruction text
4. **Fill Content**: Add real examples, business scenarios, and technical details
5. **Validate**: Ensure the final document contains only structured content, not instructions

### Content Analysis & Decision Making

When updating an existing practice file, the AI agent must:

1. **Read Existing Content**: Load the current practice file completely
2. **Identify Strengths**: Determine what content is still relevant and well-written
3. **Find Gaps**: Identify missing sections or outdated information
4. **Context Assessment**: Analyze the practice domain and current industry standards
5. **Update Strategy**: Decide which sections need complete rewrite vs. enhancement
6. **Content Preservation**: Keep valuable existing content while updating structure
7. **üî¥ CRITICAL ASSUMPTION**: When writing new files, output MUST NOT be identical to input - always restructure, enhance, and adapt content according to template structure and domain requirements
8. **Template Structure**: ALWAYS maintain the template structure format when updating best practice files - preserve section hierarchy, formatting consistency, and organizational patterns

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Input Data Analysis & Practice Detection

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Before any content integration, the AI agent must perform comprehensive input data analysis to detect and structure practices. This ensures systematic, high-quality practice extraction and prevents fragmented or incomplete implementations.

#### Phase 1: Practice Detection & Classification
**MANDATORY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**: Before any content integration, the AI agent must perform exhaustive input data analysis to detect and structure ALL practices. This ensures systematic, high-quality practice extraction and prevents fragmented or incomplete implementations.

**Analyze Input Data for Practice Patterns:**
- **Scan for Explicit Practices**: Look for keywords like "best practice", "should", "must", "avoid", "don't", "never", "always", "recommended", "required", "essential"
- **Identify Code Blocks**: Find all code examples, configuration blocks, or implementation snippets
- **Extract Recommendations**: Capture advisory statements, guidelines, and procedural instructions
- **Detect Anti-patterns**: Identify warnings, pitfalls, common mistakes, and negative examples
- **Find Implicit Practices**: Look for patterns in code comments, error messages, and documentation that imply best practices
- **Analyze Business Rules**: Extract domain-specific rules and constraints that should be practices
- **Review Error Handling**: Identify exception handling patterns and error prevention strategies
- **Examine Security Measures**: Find authentication, authorization, and data protection patterns

**MANDATORY: Ensure Complete Detection of Both Correct and Incorrect Practices:**
- **‚úÖ CORRECT PRACTICES DETECTION**: Must identify all positive practices, best approaches, recommended methods, and beneficial patterns
- **‚ùå INCORRECT PRACTICES DETECTION**: Must identify all anti-patterns, mistakes to avoid, deprecated methods, and harmful approaches
- **BALANCED COVERAGE**: Ensure equal attention to both positive and negative practices for comprehensive guidance
- **VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Cross-reference detected practices against domain standards to ensure completeness
- **MISSING PRACTICE IDENTIFICATION**: Actively look for gaps where practices should exist but are not explicitly stated

**Classify Practices by Priority:**
- **üî¥ MUST (Critical)**: Practices marked as "must", "always", "required", "essential", or have severe consequences if not followed
- **üü° SHOULD (Recommended)**: Practices marked as "should", "recommended", "preferable", or provide significant benefits
- **üü¢ COULD (Beneficial)**: Practices marked as "could", "may", "optional", or provide minor improvements
- **‚ùå WON'T (Avoid)**: Practices marked as "don't", "never", "avoid", "anti-pattern", or have negative outcomes

**Separate Positive vs Negative Practices:**
- **‚úÖ Positive Practices**: Constructive recommendations, proper implementations, beneficial approaches, best methods
- **‚ùå Negative Practices**: Anti-patterns, mistakes to avoid, harmful practices, deprecated methods, security vulnerabilities
- **MANDATORY SPLIT**: Any practice with both positive and negative aspects MUST be split into separate entries

#### Phase 2: Category Analysis & Mapping
**Analyze Existing Categories:**
- **Review Current Structure**: Examine existing practice categories in the template
- **Assess Category Fit**: Determine if detected practices align with current categories
- **Identify Gaps**: Find areas where new categories might be needed
- **Category Relationships**: Map how practices interconnect between categories

**Category Creation/Modification Strategy:**
- **Use Existing Categories**: When practices clearly fit existing categories (e.g., "Code Quality", "Security", "Performance")
- **Modify Categories**: When existing categories need renaming or scope adjustment to better fit new practices
- **Create New Categories**: When practices represent entirely new domains or specialized areas
- **Category Naming**: Use descriptive, domain-specific names that clearly indicate the category's focus

**Build Structure Tree:**
```
üìÇ Root Domain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Category 1: [Name]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Practice 1.1: [Title] (üî¥ Must)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Practice 1.2: [Title] (üü° Should)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ùå Practice 1.3: [Title] (‚ùå Won't)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Category 2: [Name]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Practice 2.1: [Title] (üü¢ Could)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Practice 2.2: [Title] (üî¥ Must)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Category 3: [Name] (New)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Practice 3.1: [Title] (üü° Should)
```

**MANDATORY: Table of Contents Structure Requirements:**
- Include all main sections (Core Principles, Design Patterns, etc.)
- Include all practice categories as second-level headers
- Include ALL individual practices as third-level headers (one level lower)
- Use proper anchor links that match actual section headers
- Ensure navigation links work correctly for all levels
- Update TOC whenever new categories or practices are added

#### Phase 3: Content Extraction & Practice Development
**For Each Detected Practice:**
- **Extract Core Concept**: Identify the main idea or principle behind the practice
- **Gather Supporting Evidence**: Collect all related code blocks, examples, and explanations
- **Analyze Context**: Understand when and where the practice applies
- **Identify Dependencies**: Determine prerequisites or related practices

**Code Block Analysis & Description:**
- **üîç Examine Code Purpose**: Understand what the code block accomplishes
- **üìù Describe Functionality**: Explain in plain English what the code does
- **üéØ Identify Key Patterns**: Highlight important programming patterns or techniques
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Note Important Details**: Point out critical implementation aspects
- **üîÑ Explain Flow**: Describe the logical flow and sequence of operations

**Example Code Block Description:**
# Original Code Block
```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    user = get_user_from_db(username)
    if user and verify_password(password, user.hashed_password):
        return create_session_token(user)
    return None
```

**AI Agent Description:**
"This code block implements user authentication by retrieving user data from database, verifying the provided password against the stored hash, and returning a session token upon successful authentication. It follows security best practices by using hashed passwords and returning None for failed authentications."

**Practice Content Assembly:**
- **Practice Name**: Create clear, descriptive name with appropriate icon (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Reason**: Explain business/technical justification based on extracted content
- **Priority**: Assign based on classification with corresponding icon (üî¥/üü°/üü¢/‚ùå)
- **Description**: Provide detailed textual explanation of the practice, incorporating code block descriptions

#### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Validation
**Validate Practice Structure:**
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure each practice has all required fields (Name, Reason, Priority, Description)
- **Icon Consistency**: Verify correct icon usage (‚úÖ/‚ùå for practice type, üî¥/üü°/üü¢/‚ùå for priority)
- **Category Alignment**: Confirm practices are appropriately placed in categories
- **Content Accuracy**: Validate that extracted information accurately represents the source material

**Cross-Reference Analysis:**
- **Practice Relationships**: Identify dependencies between practices
- **Category Dependencies**: Map relationships between categories
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify any conflicting practices that need resolution

### Input Data Processing & Content Matching

When processing input data (from user requests, external sources, or existing files), the AI agent must follow this systematic approach:

#### üî¥ FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: Output ‚â† Input
**MANDATORY ASSUMPTION**: When creating new best practices files, the output MUST NOT be identical to the input source. AI agents must always:
- Restructure content according to template format
- Enhance and adapt information for the target domain
- Add comprehensive descriptions and context
- Organize practices into logical categories
- Apply template structure and formatting consistently
- Transform raw input into structured, actionable guidance

#### Step 1: Content Analysis
- **Extract All Content**: Identify all practices, examples, patterns, and concepts from input data
- **Categorize Information**: Group related content by theme, domain, or functionality
- **Assess Relevance**: Determine which content is relevant to the target domain and BIS repository context
- **Identify Quality**: Evaluate the quality, accuracy, and completeness of each piece of content

#### Step 2: Template Structure Matching
- **Map to Existing Categories**: Try to match input content with existing practice categories in the template
- **Find Best Fit**: For each piece of content, identify the most appropriate existing category or practice
- **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the template's hierarchical organization and formatting
- **Validate Compatibility**: Ensure new content fits within the established template framework

#### Step 3: Content Integration Strategy
**If content matches existing structure:**
- **Reuse All Content**: Integrate the maximum possible content from input data
- **Enhance Existing Practices**: Add new examples, details, or variations to existing practices
- **Update Examples**: Replace generic examples with specific, domain-relevant ones from input data
- **Preserve Business Context**: Keep valuable business scenarios and use cases from input data

**If content cannot match existing practices:**
- **Create New Practice**: Add a new practice within the most appropriate existing category
- **Define Practice Structure**: Follow the template format with Practice Name, Reason, Priority, Description
- **Set Appropriate Priority**: Assign üî¥ Must, üü° Should, üü¢ Could, or ‚ùå Won't based on business impact and include ‚úÖ in practice name for positive practices, ‚ùå for negative practices
- **Include Comprehensive Details**: Add implementation steps, business impact, and validation criteria

**If content cannot match existing categories:**
- **Create New Category**: Add a new category section following template structure
- **Name Category Appropriately**: Use descriptive, domain-specific category names
- **Add Practice Within Category**: Create at least one practice within the new category
- **Update Table of Contents**: Add the new category to the comprehensive table of contents
- **Maintain Navigation**: Ensure all navigation links work correctly with the new category

#### Step 4: Default Fallback Strategy
**If all matching attempts fail:**
- **Create "Others" Category**: Add a new category named "Others" as the final fallback
- **Add Practice to Others**: Create a new practice within the "Others" category
- **Use Generic Naming**: Name the practice descriptively based on the input content
- **Document Rationale**: Include clear explanation of why content was placed in "Others"
- **Plan for Refactoring**: Note that "Others" category should be reviewed and potentially reorganized

#### Step 5: Content Optimization
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove duplicate content while preserving unique value
- **Consolidate Similar Items**: Merge similar practices or examples for clarity
- **Prioritize High-Impact Content**: Focus on content with the greatest business or technical impact
- **Ensure Consistency**: Make sure all content follows the same style and format as the template

#### Step 6: Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Reference Check**: Ensure all internal references and links are accurate
- **Template Compliance**: Verify that all additions maintain template structure and formatting
- **Content Quality**: Validate that all practices include proper descriptions, examples, and business impact
- **Navigation Integrity**: Confirm that table of contents and all navigation links work correctly

### Section-by-Section Update Logic

#### Header Section Updates
- **Keep**: Domain name, target audience, scope if still accurate
- **Update**: Path patterns, file references, contact information
- **Add**: Missing header elements from template if not present

#### Core Principles Updates
- **Preserve**: Well-written principles that are still relevant
- **Enhance**: Add missing principle categories (foundations, values, philosophy)
- **Update**: Refresh examples and business impacts with current data
- **Expand**: Add new principles based on industry evolution

#### Design Patterns Updates
- **Keep**: Proven patterns that are still effective
- **Add**: New patterns that have emerged in the domain
- **Update**: Refresh anti-patterns and use cases with current examples
- **Enhance**: Add missing pattern categories if not covered

#### Industry References Updates
- **Update**: Refresh standards, references, and benchmarks with current versions
- **Add**: New industry resources and tools that have emerged
- **Validate**: Ensure all links and references are still active
- **Expand**: Add missing reference categories

#### Practice Categories Updates
- **Review**: Assess existing practice categories and their relevance to current domain needs
- **Update**: Refresh practice examples and implementation guidance with current best practices
- **Add**: Create new categories or practices based on technology evolution and domain requirements
- **Reorganize**: Adjust practice priorities (Must/Should/Could/Won't) based on business impact and implementation feasibility
- **Consolidate**: Merge similar categories or split large categories for better organization

### User Prompt Processing

When user provides update instructions:

1. **Parse Request**: Understand what specific changes or additions are requested
2. **Context Analysis**: Determine which sections are affected by the request
3. **Content Integration**: Seamlessly integrate new information into existing content
4. **Related Updates**: Identify other sections that may need updates based on the change

**Apply to:** All Python files in BIS repository (`engine/src/**/*.py`)
```

### Example 2: Filled Practice Category Section
```
### Category 1: Code Quality and Standards

**Category Description:** Practices focused on maintaining high code quality, readability, and consistency across the development team.

#### ‚úÖ Use Pathlib for File Operations
- **Reason:** Ensures cross-platform compatibility and modern Python practices for file handling.
- **Priority:** üî¥ Must
- **Description:** Utilize pathlib.Path objects for all file operations instead of os.path to achieve platform-independent, readable, and object-oriented file system interactions. This approach provides consistent path handling across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems while offering intuitive methods for common operations. The pathlib module eliminates the need for manual path joining and provides better error handling, making code more maintainable and less prone to platform-specific bugs that can cause deployment issues in diverse environments.

#### ‚ùå Avoid os.path for File Operations
- **Reason:** Prevents platform-dependent code and improves readability.
- **Priority:** ‚ùå Won't
- **Description:** Refrain from using os.path methods for file operations as they require manual path joining, are less readable, and can lead to platform-specific issues; instead, adopt pathlib for consistent and modern file handling.
```

### Example 4: Input Data Processing & Content Matching
```
#### Scenario: Adding Security Practices from External Source
**Input Data**: Webpage content about API security best practices
**AI Action**:
1. **Extract Content**: Identify 15 security practices from the webpage
2. **Match to Categories**: Map 8 practices to existing "Security Best Practices" category
3. **Create New Practice**: Add 5 practices as new entries in existing categories
4. **Create New Category**: Add "API Security" category for 2 specialized practices
5. **Fallback Strategy**: No need for "Others" category as all content was successfully matched

#### Scenario: Generic Content That Doesn't Fit
**Input Data**: Miscellaneous development tips without clear domain focus
**AI Action**:
1. **Extract Content**: Identify 20 various development tips
2. **Match Attempt**: Only 3 tips match existing categories
3. **Create New Practices**: Add 12 tips as new practices in appropriate categories
4. **Create New Category**: Add "Development Tools" category for tool-specific tips
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Use "Others" category for 5 remaining generic tips

#### Scenario: Complete Content Reuse
**Input Data**: Existing best practices document from another project
**AI Action**:
1. **Extract Content**: Load entire existing document structure
2. **Match Categories**: Map all 8 categories to template structure
3. **Reuse Content**: Preserve 90% of original content with template formatting
4. **Enhance Structure**: Add missing template sections (benchmarks, key terms)
5. **Update Examples**: Replace outdated examples with current best practices
```
## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Placeholder Text Remains
**Solution:** Use search/replace to find all `[placeholder]` patterns and replace with domain-specific content.

### Issue: Output Too Similar to Input
**Solution:** Remember the fundamental principle - output MUST NOT be identical to input. Always restructure content according to template format, enhance descriptions with additional context, reorganize practices into logical categories, and adapt content for the target domain. Add comprehensive explanations and ensure proper formatting.

### Issue: Practice Descriptions Too Short

### Issue: Missing Practice Detection
**Solution:** Re-scan input data using expanded keyword lists including "guideline", "recommendation", "pattern", "anti-pattern", "pitfall", "trap", "best approach", "avoid this", "don't do that". Actively look for both positive and negative practices to ensure balanced coverage.

### Issue: Incorrect Priority Classification
**Solution:** Review practice context and reclassify based on business impact: MUST for critical requirements, SHOULD for strong recommendations, COULD for beneficial options, WON'T for harmful practices.

### Issue: Category Mapping Problems
**Solution:** Create new categories when existing ones don't fit, or modify category names to better reflect the practice content. Use descriptive, domain-specific category names.

### Issue: Code Block Description Unclear
**Solution:** Break down code functionality into smaller logical steps and explain each part in plain English. Focus on what the code accomplishes rather than how it works syntactically.

### Issue: Missing Practice Relationships
**Solution:** Analyze practice dependencies and add cross-references. Identify prerequisite practices and related concepts that should be mentioned.

### Issue: Inconsistent Formatting
**Solution:** Ensure all practice sections follow the structure: Practice Name, Reason, Priority, Description.

### Issue: Missing Business Impact
**Solution:** For each principle and practice, add specific, measurable business benefits in the Reason field.

### Issue: Broken Cross-References
**Solution:** Verify all links in table of contents match actual section headers.

### Issue: Code Examples in Descriptions
**Solution:** Replace code examples with textual descriptions using proper terminology for AI understanding.

### Issue: Unsplitted Practices
**Solution:** Split practices that have both positive and negative aspects into separate entries with appropriate priorities.

### Issue: Content Conflicts
**Solution:** When new content conflicts with existing content, prioritize accuracy, completeness, user requests, and template compliance.

### Issue: Missing Template Sections
**Solution:** Compare with template structure and add any missing sections with appropriate content.

### Issue: Outdated References
**Solution:** Update industry standards, benchmarks, and examples with current information.

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### For New Practice Files:
1. Replace `[DOMAIN]` with your specific domain (e.g., "Python", "SQL", "Business Analysis")
2. Replace `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` with specific audience (e.g., "AI Agents, Python Developers")
3. Replace `[PATH_PATTERN]` with file patterns (e.g., `engine/src/**/*.py`)
4. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: When writing new files, output MUST NOT be identical to input - always restructure and enhance content according to template structure
5. Fill each section with domain-specific content
6. Replace all `[placeholder]` text with meaningful content
7. Run validation checklist
8. Save as `best-practices-[domain].md`

### For Updating Existing Files:
1. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Analyze input data to detect ALL practices (both correct and incorrect) and classify by priority (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
2. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Map practices to categories (use existing or create/modify new ones)
3. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Extract and describe code blocks in plain text explanations
4. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Ensure each practice description is at least 3 sentences long and comprehensive
5. Load existing practice file
6. Analyze content quality and gaps
7. Map existing content to template sections
8. Preserve valuable content, update outdated information
9. Add missing sections from template
10. Integrate user-requested changes
11. Validate and save updated file
