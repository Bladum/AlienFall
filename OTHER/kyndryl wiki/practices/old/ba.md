## 🎯 Agent Mission & Usage Guide
<div align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></div>

### Purpose
This guide provides comprehensive business analysis standards for AI agents working on the BIS repository. It combines business methodology, stakeholder management, and documentation patterns to ensure consistent, actionable, and stakeholder-focused business analysis deliverables.

### How AI Agents Should Use This Guide

**Decision-Making Framework:**
- **MANDATORY PRACTICES**: Must always be applied (KPI definitions, risk classification, stakeholder RACI, acceptance criteria)
- **CONTEXTUAL PRACTICES**: Apply based on business context (SIPOC diagrams for process analysis, advanced analytics for complex cases)
- **ENHANCEMENT PRACTICES**: Apply when improving existing documentation or when explicitly requested

**User Prompts & Enforcement:**
- **"Apply all practices"**: Agent MUST implement ALL applicable practices from this guide
- **"Force update documentation"**: Agent MUST overwrite existing BA documents completely
- **"Enforce best practices"**: Agent selects and applies relevant practices based on business context

**Scope of Autonomy:**
- Agents can decide which practices are relevant to the current business analysis task
- When in doubt, err on the side of applying more comprehensive analysis rather than less
- Always log what practices were applied for transparency and audit trails

---

## 🏗️ Core Principles & Business Framework
<div align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></div>

### Business-First Architecture (MANDATORY)

The BIS business analysis follows a **stakeholder-centric** design with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Business Strategy Layer   │  ← Outcomes, KPIs, value proposition
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Requirements Layer          │  ← Functional, non-functional, constraints
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Implementation Layer        │  ← Technical solution, architecture
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
*Reason: This correctly implements business-first analysis by starting with business outcomes and working down to implementation, ensuring all technical decisions align with business value.*

```markdown
## Business Outcome
**Goal**: Reduce customer churn by 15% within 6 months
**KPI**: Monthly churn rate < 5%
**Owner**: VP Customer Success

## Requirements
**Functional**: Real-time churn prediction dashboard
**Non-Functional**: 99.5% uptime, <2 second response time
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing CRM

## Implementation Approach
**Technical Solution**: Machine learning pipeline with PowerBI dashboard
**Architecture**: Delegate to technical team after requirements approval
```

**❌ Wrong Implementation:**
*Reason: This violates business-first principles by jumping straight to technical solutions without defining business outcomes, KPIs, or stakeholder needs. This leads to solutions that may not address actual business problems.*

```markdown
## Technical Solution
We need a Python ML model using scikit-learn to predict churn.
Database: PostgreSQL with real-time analytics.
Dashboard: React frontend with REST API.
```

### Core BA Principles (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Outcome-Driven Analysis
All analysis must start with clear business outcomes and success metrics.

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
*Reason: Starts with measurable business outcome, defines success criteria, and includes ownership. This ensures all subsequent analysis serves a clear business purpose.*

```markdown
## Business Outcome
**Problem**: Customer support resolution time averaging 4.2 hours
**Target Outcome**: Reduce average resolution time to <2 hours
**Success Metric**: Average resolution time ≤ 2 hours for 95% of tickets
**Business Impact**: $2M annual savings in operational costs
**Owner**: Director of Customer Operations
```

#### 2. Stakeholder-Centric Approach
Every requirement must be traceable to specific stakeholder needs.

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
*Reason: Links each requirement to specific stakeholders with clear value justification and acceptance criteria.*

```markdown
## Stakeholder Requirements Map

| Requirement | Stakeholder | Value | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Real-time ticket status | Support Agents | Reduce context switching | Status updates within 5 seconds |
| Escalation alerts | Support Managers | Proactive management | Automated alerts for >2hr tickets |
| Performance metrics | VP Operations | Strategic visibility | Daily executive dashboard |
```

#### 3. Risk-First Documentation
Assumptions and risks must be explicitly documented and classified.

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
*Reason: Uses clear risk classification system with impact assessment and mitigation strategies, enabling proactive risk management.*

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Classification | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------|------------|
| API rate limits | High | 🔴 Blocking | Technical | Implement caching layer |
| Stakeholder availability | Medium | 🟡 Partial | Resource | Weekly commitment confirmation |
| Data quality issues | Low | 🟢 Minor | Data | Automated validation rules |
```

### 🎯 Agent Decision Framework

#### Trigger Word Recognition (MANDATORY)
**AI agents MUST recognize these user prompts and respond accordingly:**

| User Prompt Pattern | Agent Action | Scope | Documentation Level |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| **"complete business analysis"** | Apply ALL applicable practices | Full document | Complete rewrite |
| **"analyze requirements"** | Apply business requirements practices | Requirements sections | Selective updates |
| **"map stakeholders"** | Apply stakeholder analysis practices | Stakeholder sections | Targeted updates |
| **"extract from [source]"** | Apply AI discovery patterns | Extraction tasks | New content |
| **"validate business case"** | Apply validation practices | Quality checks | Incremental validation |
| **"document assumptions"** | Apply risk/assumption practices | Risk sections | Targeted documentation |

#### Decision Tree for Practice Application

```
User Request
    ├── Contains "complete" or "full analysis"?
    │   ├── Yes → Apply ALL relevant practices
    │   └── No → Check specific domain
    ├── Contains stakeholder keywords?
    │   ├── Yes → Apply stakeholder analysis practices
    │   └── No → Continue evaluation
    ├── Contains risk/assumption keywords?
    │   ├── Yes → Apply risk assessment practices
    │   └── No → Apply contextual practices based on content
    └── Default → Apply mandatory practices only
```

### 🔄 Documentation vs Enhancement Rules

#### Complete Documentation Triggers (MANDATORY)
**Agent MUST create comprehensive documentation when:**
- User says "complete", "full", "comprehensive", "from scratch"
- User says "complete business analysis"

```python
# Agent logic for practice selection
def select_ba_practices(document_type: str, user_prompt: str, content: str = "") -> list:
    practices = []
    
    # Mandatory practices for all BA documents
    practices.extend(['kpi_definitions', 'stakeholder_raci', 'risk_classification'])
    
    # Context-specific practices
    if 'requirements' in document_type.lower():
        practices.extend(['functional_requirements', 'acceptance_criteria'])
    
    if 'stakeholder' in user_prompt.lower():
        practices.extend(['stakeholder_mapping', 'influence_analysis'])
        
    if 'process' in content.lower():
        practices.extend(['sipoc_diagram', 'workflow_mapping'])
        
    if 'risk' in user_prompt.lower():
        practices.extend(['risk_assessment', 'mitigation_planning'])
    
    return list(set(practices))  # Remove duplicates
```

## 📊 Business Requirements Structure

<div align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></div>

### Problem Statement Analysis (MANDATORY)

**Business problems must be analyzed with quantified impact and clear causality.**

**✅ Correct Problem Statement:**
*Reason: Specific, measurable impact with clear causality and affected stakeholders. Provides baseline for solution evaluation.*

```markdown
## Problem Statement

**Problem**: Customer service resolution time exceeds industry standards
**Current State**: Average resolution time of 4.2 hours (industry benchmark: 2.0 hours)
**Business Impact**: 
- Customer satisfaction score declined to 65% (target: 90%)
- 23% increase in customer churn over 6 months
- $2.1M annual revenue at risk
**Affected Stakeholders**: 
- Customers (poor experience)
- Support agents (overwhelming workload)
- Sales team (reputation impact)
**Root Cause**: Manual ticket routing and lack of priority classification
**Urgency**: Critical - Q3 customer retention targets at risk
```

**❌ Wrong Problem Statement:**
*Reason: Vague, unmeasurable, no business impact quantification, and no stakeholder analysis. Impossible to validate solutions or measure success.*

```markdown
## Problem Statement
Customer service is slow and customers are unhappy. We need better tools to help our support team work faster.
```

### Solution Definition Patterns (MANDATORY)

**Solutions must be defined in terms of business capabilities, not technical implementation.**

**✅ Correct Solution Definition:**
*Reason: Focuses on business capabilities and outcomes while leaving technical implementation flexible. Includes measurable success criteria.*

```markdown
## Solution Definition

**Business Capability**: Intelligent customer service management platform
**Core Functions**:
1. Automated ticket routing based on customer tier and issue complexity
2. Real-time workload balancing across support agents
3. Escalation management with SLA monitoring
4. Customer communication automation for status updates

**Success Criteria**:
- Average resolution time ≤ 2.0 hours
- Customer satisfaction score ≥ 90%
- Support agent productivity increased by 40%
- 95% SLA compliance for priority tickets

**Non-Goals**:
- Customer self-service portal (separate project)
- Integration with third-party CRM systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting (phase 2)

**Essential Properties**:
- Real-time processing (≤ 30 seconds for routing decisions)
- 99.9% uptime during business hours
- Scalable to 1000+ concurrent tickets
- Audit trail for all customer interactions
```

**❌ Wrong Solution Definition:**
*Reason: Jumps to technical implementation without defining business value or success criteria. No measurable outcomes or stakeholder considerations.*

```markdown
## Solution Definition
Build a web application with React frontend and Node.js backend. Use PostgreSQL database for ticket storage and implement machine learning for ticket classification.
```

### Value Proposition Framework (CONTEXTUAL)

**Value propositions should quantify business benefits with ROI analysis.**

**✅ Correct Value Proposition:**
*Reason: Quantified benefits with clear ROI calculation and timeline. Links business outcomes to specific stakeholder value.*

```markdown
## Value Proposition Analysis

**Investment Required**: $850K (development + first year operation)

**Quantified Benefits** (Annual):
| Benefit Category | Current Cost | Target Cost | Annual Savings |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Support Operations | $3.2M | $2.4M | $800K |
| Customer Churn | $2.1M | $600K | $1.5M |
| Agent Overtime | $450K | $180K | $270K |
| **Total Benefits** | **$5.75M** | **$3.18M** | **$2.57M** |

**ROI Calculation**:
- Net Annual Benefit: $2.57M - $850K = $1.72M
- ROI: 202%
- Payback Period: 4.9 months

**Stakeholder Value**:
- **Customers**: Faster resolution, improved satisfaction
- **Support Team**: Reduced stress, focus on complex issues
- **Management**: Cost reduction, improved metrics
- **Sales**: Better customer references, reduced churn impact

**Risk-Adjusted ROI**: 145% (accounting for 30% implementation risk)
```
