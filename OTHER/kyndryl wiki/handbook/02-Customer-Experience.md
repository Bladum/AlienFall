### Detailed Onboarding Steps

1. **🔑 Data access agreements** and sample files reviewed
2. **🧩 Owners and scoring weights** documented for autoranking
3. **🧪 Validation** with redacted real data; acceptance per practice
4. **📨 First delivery** to pilot owners; confirm experience and cadence

### Technical Setup Steps

**Account Creation:**
1. Request account creation from system administrator
2. Get added to appropriate GIAM group (e.g., WIN_OPS_PL_LOC_IMG)
3. Use RDP to connect to BIS Server (10.17.80.23)

**BIS & DBeaver Configuration:**
1. Run BIS via script: `E:\run BIS.bat`
2. Select RAC (Report as Code) → Click START
3. Switch to DataLake tab → Create personal DB connection
4. This generates: `E:\Users\{username}\Documents\{tenant}.duckdb`

**DBeaver Setup:**
1. Install DBeaver Community Edition
2. Add DuckDB JDBC driver from DuckDB website
3. Connect to personal `.duckdb` file
4. Set bootstrap with: `SET file_search_path TO 'E:\data\BIS\workspace\{tenant}\data'`

### Data Storage Locations
- **E:\master**: Output data in Parquet format
- **E:\prod**: Incoming data in Parquet format
- **E:\raw**: Human-readable input data
- **E:\spec**: Jobs and specs by workspace

### Query Development
1. Open DBeaver and connect to personal DB
2. Refresh connection if no data visible
3. Execute SQL against registered Parquet views
4. Export results for analysis as needed

### Additional Setup
- **Owners and Weights**: Define stakeholders, assign owners to actions, set priority weights in CSV for autoranking
- **Training**: Conduct sessions on GUI usage, YAML authoring, troubleshooting
- **Support**: Establish email or chat channels for ongoing questions

### Benefits of Structured Onboarding
- Smooth adoption with clear guidance, reducing trial-and-error
- Reduced setup time through pre-configured templates and examples
- Early value realization by focusing on high-impact indicators first
