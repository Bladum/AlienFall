## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Team Visibility
- **Shared Vision**: All units in a team share visibility
- **Three States**: Hidden (black), Explored (dim), Visible (bright)
- **Update Frequency**: Recalculate on unit movement or environment change
- **LOS Algorithm**: Bresenham's line algorithm on 2D grid

### 2. Rendering Pipeline
- **2D â†’ 3D**: Game logic on 2D grid, render in 3D
- **Lighting**: Based on visibility state (not physical lighting)
- **Culling**: Frustum + visibility-based culling
- **Billboards**: Units always face camera

### 3. Physics
- **2D Physics Only**: Box2D for projectiles and collisions
- **Position Sync**: Physics bodies sync with logical grid positions
- **Bullets**: Kinematic bodies with ray-cast prediction

### 4. Modularity
- **Class Inheritance**: Unit â†’ PlayerUnit, EnemyUnit, NeutralUnit
- **System Interfaces**: Clear update() and draw() methods
- **Event System**: Consider event-driven architecture for actions
- **Config Files**: Lua tables for unit stats, terrain properties

## Love2D 12 Features to Use
- `love.graphics.readbackTexture()` for canvas operations
- Proper mesh vertex formats with named fields
- Updated depth mode API
- Modern shader syntax
- Efficient batch rendering

## Performance Targets
- 60 FPS with 100+ units
- Sub-100ms visibility calculations
- Minimal garbage collection
- < 200 draw calls per frame

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for math utilities
- Integration tests for systems
- Visual tests for rendering
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection

## Extensibility Points
- New terrain types via Tile subclasses
- New unit types via Unit subclasses
- New effects via TileEffect subclasses
- New weapons via Bullet subclasses
- Data-driven configuration for easy modding

## Implementation Notes
- Start with minimal working version of each phase
- Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
- Keep old version as reference but don't mix code
- Document as you go, not at the end
- Profile early and often

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure
2. Set up conf.lua for Love2D 12
3. Implement Phase 1: Foundation classes
4. Begin Phase 2: Map loading system
