# Unit Movement Controls - Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Map Not Loading
**Status**: ✅ **FALSE ALARM** - The map WAS loading correctly!
- The PNG file at `assets/maps/maze_map.png` was loading successfully
- A 60x60 grid was being created with proper terrain types
- The issue was that nothing was RENDERING, not that the map wasn't loading

### Problem 2: WASDQE Controls Not Working for Unit Movement
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
- **Previous behavior**: WASD moved the camera, not units
- **New behavior**: WASD moves the selected unit, camera follows automatically

## Changes Made

### 1. InputHandler.lua - Complete Rewrite of Movement System
**File**: `systems/InputHandler.lua`

#### Changed Functions:
- **`InputHandler.update(dt, camera, game)`** - Now requires `game` parameter
  - Reads WASD input to move the **selected unit** (not camera)
  - Q/E rotates the **selected unit** (not camera)
  - Applies movement with collision detection
  - Automatically updates camera to follow unit

- **`InputHandler.moveUnit(unit, dx, dz, map)`** - NEW FUNCTION
  - Moves unit smoothly across the map
  - Checks terrain walkability (walls block movement)
  - Checks tile occupancy (can't move through other units)
  - Updates tile occupant tracking

- **`InputHandler.updateCameraToFollowUnit(camera, unit, dt)`** - NEW FUNCTION
  - Positions camera behind and above the selected unit
  - Smoothly follows unit as it moves
  - Camera looks at the unit position
  - Camera rotates based on unit facing direction

#### Removed Functions:
- `InputHandler.moveCameraRelative()` - No longer needed
- `InputHandler.rotateCamera()` - Camera now follows unit automatically

### 2. main.lua - Integration Changes
**File**: `main.lua`

#### Unit Initialization:
- Added `unit.tileX` and `unit.tileY` tracking for current tile position
- Added `unit.facing` initialization (rotation angle in radians)
- Player units face north (0 radians)
- Enemy units face south (π radians)

#### Update Loop:
- Changed `InputHandler.update(dt, g3d.camera)` 
- To `InputHandler.update(dt, g3d.camera, game)`
- Removed `Renderer3D.updateCamera()` call (now handled by InputHandler)

#### Controls Documentation:
Updated help text to show:
```
WASD/Arrows - Move selected unit
Q/E - Rotate selected unit  
SPACE - Switch to next unit
M - Toggle minimap
ESC - Quit
```

### 3. Renderer3D.lua - Debug Output Improvements
**File**: `systems/Renderer3D.lua`

- Reduced spam in console output
- Added tile/unit rendering counters
- Added model validation checks
- Better visibility debugging

## How It Works Now

### Unit Movement Flow:
1. Player presses **W** key
2. `InputHandler.update()` detects key press
3. Calculates movement vector based on unit's facing direction
4. Calls `moveUnit()` to apply movement with collision
5. `moveUnit()` checks if target tile is walkable and unoccupied
6. If valid, updates unit position smoothly
7. `updateCameraToFollowUnit()` positions camera behind unit
8. Camera smoothly follows and looks at unit

### Unit Rotation:
1. Player presses **Q** or **E**
2. Unit's `facing` angle is adjusted
3. Camera rotates with unit to stay behind it
4. Movement direction changes based on new facing

### Unit Selection:
1. Player presses **SPACE**
2. `InputHandler.selectNextUnit()` cycles through player team units
3. New unit becomes selected
4. Camera immediately starts following new unit

## Testing the Fixes

To test the new controls:

1. **Run the game**: `lovec .` from the game directory
2. **First unit is auto-selected** - Camera starts behind first player unit
3. **Press W** - Unit moves forward (in facing direction)
4. **Press A/D** - Unit strafes left/right
5. **Press S** - Unit moves backward
6. **Press Q/E** - Unit rotates left/right
7. **Press SPACE** - Switch to next unit (camera follows new unit)

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Units move smoothly across floor tiles
- ✅ Units cannot move through walls
- ✅ Units cannot move through other units
- ✅ Camera follows selected unit automatically
- ✅ Camera rotates with unit when Q/E is pressed
- ✅ Switching units transfers camera smoothly

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Mouse click to select units
- [ ] Move-to-cursor pathfinding
- [ ] Turn-based movement system
- [ ] Movement points / action points
- [ ] Animation for unit movement
- [ ] Footstep sounds
- [ ] Unit collision pushback

## Technical Notes

### Coordinate System:
- Grid coordinates: `unit.gridX`, `unit.gridY` (can be fractional for smooth movement)
- Tile coordinates: `unit.tileX`, `unit.tileY` (integer, tracks which tile unit is on)
- World coordinates: Same as grid coordinates in this implementation

### Facing Direction:
- Stored in radians: `unit.facing`
- 0 = North (negative Z)
- π/2 = East (positive X)
- π = South (positive Z)
- 3π/2 = West (negative X)

### Camera Position:
- Distance behind unit: 10 units
- Height above ground: 8 units
- Looks at unit center (height 0.5)
- Smoothly interpolates to new position (lerp with smoothing factor)
