- **T-shirt Sizing:** XS, S, M, L, XL for effort estimation
- **Definition of Ready:** Clear owners, data access, acceptance criteria

### Work Organization
- **Streams:** Engine, Workspace, Excel, Delivery
- **Epics:** Group related stories (e.g., "Improve Excel Reporting")
- **User Stories:** "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"

---

## Release and Deployment Strategy

### Environments
- **Dev:** Local development and testing
- **Test:** Shared testing environment
- **Pilot:** Customer staging environment
- **Prod:** Live production environment

### Branching Strategy
- **Main:** Production-ready code
- **Dev:** Development integration branch
- **Feature Branches:** Individual feature development

### Release Cadence
- **Weekly Releases:** Regular feature releases
- **Hotfixes:** Critical bug fixes as needed
- **Versioning:** Managed via release.yml

---

## Platform Evolution Plan

### Migration Strategy
- **Robocorp:** For RPA and orchestration capabilities
- **Databricks:** For cloud data lake storage
- **DuckDB:** Maintain local development parity

### Experimentation Framework
- Controlled experiments with clear success criteria
- ADR documentation for architectural decisions
- Default to simple single-host model unless scale demands change

---

## Deployment Rings and Environments

### Ring Structure
- **Dev Ring:** Rapid iteration and feature testing
- **Test Ring:** User acceptance testing
- **Pilot Ring:** Limited production deployment
- **Prod Ring:** Full production release

### Promotion Criteria
- Automated CI checks must pass
- Manual approvals for production deployment
- Data hygiene and security validation
- Performance and compatibility testing

---

## Release Cycles

### Engine vs Reports
- **Coordinated Trains:** Engine and reports release together
- **Compatibility Guarantees:** Backward compatibility maintained
- **Hotfix Strategy:** Forward-fix with retrofit guidance

### Cycle Management

---

## Implementation Stages & Outcomes

BIS can be implemented in stages, each building on the previous:

### 1. Report as Code (RAC)
- Collect requirements, connect data sources, deliver reports (including SLA reports).
- Assumes stable, fixed reporting needs.

### 2. Business Observability (BO)
- Integrate all SLAs and metrics into a single, holistic view.
- Monitor monthly and daily metrics, consult reports to improve business results.
- Assumes flexible, frequently changing requirements.

### 3. Service Management Augmentation (SMA)
- Integrate with ITSM and CSI processes.
- Define stakeholders/owners, deliver personalized actions.

### Outcomes & Products
- **Generic Reports**: Configured as code, generated in Excel, with rich visualization.
- **SLA Reports**: Monthly (closed period) and daily (month-to-date) snapshots.
- **Business Observability Dashboards**: Unified, filterable views for stakeholders.
- **Augmented Actions**: Automated, prioritized notifications to owners, replacing manual coordination.
- **Automated documentation**: All code and configuration is self-documented for AI agents.
