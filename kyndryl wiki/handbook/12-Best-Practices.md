## Purpose & How to Use This File

This page helps you pick the best model for a task, balancing fit, speed, and cost. Prompt: "My task is X; I need fast results and low cost" and consult the quick-pick table below, then task-specific sections for detail.

Notes on COST: In GitHub Copilot, "cost" refers to premium requests. On paid plans, included models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini) consume 0 premium requests; premium models deduct from your monthly premium request allowance according to a multiplier. On Copilot Free, all chat interactions consume premium requests. See GitHub Copilot billing docs for details.

## General Comment on Quality vs Speed vs Cost

The relationship between **quality**, **speed**, and **cost** is not linear but often reflects a strategic choice. The highest-rated models, such as **GPT-5 Full**, consistently deliver superior quality, but this comes at the highest cost and slowest speeds, making them ideal for mission-critical tasks where correctness is paramount.

For general use, models like **GPT-4.1** offer an excellent combination of high speed, strong quality, and zero cost, positioning them as the best all-around choice for most common tasks. Other models, like **Grok Fast Code 1**, provide an extreme trade-off, delivering solid quality at a low cost and the highest speed, perfect for cost-sensitive operations. The final choice depends on the user's primary need: ultimate quality, rapid execution, or cost efficiency.

---

## AI Model Comparison

Legend: 
- Quality = 1⭐–10⭐ 
- Speed = 1⚡–10⚡ (higher is faster) 
- Copilot Cost = numeric premium-request multiplier (e.g., 0, 0.25, 1, 1.25, 10). 0 means included; higher means more costly.

| Model | Rating ⭐ | Cost 💰 | Speed ⚡ | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GPT-4.1 | 10 | 0 | 7 | Its massive context and speed make it the undisputed top choice for generating cohesive, multi-file project structures quickly and for free. |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 9 | 1 | 4 | Very capable of handling a huge context, ensuring consistency across a large project. The best choice after GPT-4.1 for this task. |
| GPT-5 Full | 8 | 1.5 | 3 | Provides high quality scaffolding, but its limited context and slow speed make it less effective than the top-tier free models for this task. |
| GPT-5 mini | 7 | 0.5 | 5 | A solid choice for multi-file projects, offering a good balance of quality and speed without the premium cost. |
| Grok Fast Code 1 | 6 | 0.25 | 9 | Extremely fast and low-cost, it can generate basic project structures but may lack the depth and consistency of higher-rated models. |
| GPT-4o | 5 | 0 | 6 | Slower and with a smaller context than GPT-4.1, making it less ideal for large, complex project scaffolding. |
| Sonnet 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | Its slow speed and high cost make it impractical for project scaffolding tasks. |
| GPT-4o mini | 3 | 0 | 8 | Fast and free, but its Medium context limits its ability to maintain consistency across multiple files. |
| Sonnet 3.7 Thinking | 2 | 1.25 | 1 | The slowest model, making it unsuitable for any task requiring efficiency. |

## AI-First Project Principles & BIS Philosophy

### AI-First Approach
BIS is designed from the ground up to be AI-friendly, supporting generative AI agents and human developers alike. All documentation, code, and configuration are structured for AI-first consumption, enabling:
- Automated code generation (SQL, YAML, Python) with context-rich comments.
- AI agent instructions for code changes: always provide only the code that changes, with file and line context.
- Continuous improvement: feedback and documentation are merged and clarified in this single source of truth.

### Assumptions & Prerequisites
- BIS requires clear business requirements, access to relevant data sources, and defined stakeholders/owners. If these inputs exist, BIS can be deployed and deliver value immediately ("good to go").
- Internal and external perspectives are supported: BIS is used for both customer-facing and internal (e.g., audit, control points) use cases.
