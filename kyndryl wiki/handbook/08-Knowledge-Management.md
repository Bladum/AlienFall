## Handbook Maintenance and Content Management

### Purpose and Scope
This section provides comprehensive best practices for maintaining and updating the BIS Handbook. It ensures the handbook remains a comprehensive, up-to-date reference for the BIS project, incorporating content from repository files and maintaining structural integrity.

### General Maintenance Principles

#### Structure Integrity
- **Fixed Structure:** Maintain the established H1, H2, and H3 structure. Do not add or remove major sections without approval
- **Final Markdown:** Remove all scaffold texts, instructions, or placeholders. The file must be ready for human reading
- **Content Sourcing:** Update sections with relevant information from repository files, integrated content, and authoritative sources

#### Content Quality Standards
- **Content Depth:** Ensure sections are comprehensive; avoid short paragraphs without substance
- **Formatting Excellence:** Use tables, emojis, colors, code blocks, and diagrams for clarity and engagement
- **High-Level Summaries:** Provide overviews and link to detailed files for in-depth information
- **References:** Include links to authoritative sources within the repository

#### Integration and Consistency
- **Legacy Integration:** Actively integrate substantive content from legacy files before removal
- **Prompt Engineering:** Use improved prompt templates for authoring instruction-driven agents, ensuring determinism, security compliance, and BIS standards
- **Cross-References:** Maintain consistent linking between sections and external files

### Content Assessment Framework

#### Content to Integrate
- **Technical Concepts:** Architectural details, design patterns, system concepts
- **Business Logic:** Process flows, decision frameworks, business rules
- **Best Practices:** Proven methodologies, standards, guidelines
- **Reference Material:** APIs, schemas, configuration examples

#### Content to Avoid
- **Procedural Instructions:** Step-by-step setup guides (link to specific docs instead)
- **Navigation Content:** "How to find X" instructions
- **Redundant Information:** Content already covered in linked files
- **Transient Details:** Temporary configurations or environment-specific data

## Content Integration Workflows

### Standard Update Process
1. **Identify Changes:** Review recent commits, issues, or PRs for new content
2. **Gather Sources:** Read relevant files and check for integration opportunities
3. **Update Sections:** Use precise editing tools for targeted updates
4. **Validate:** Check formatting, links, and completeness
5. **Review:** Ensure alignment with project standards and goals
6. **Commit:** Use clear commit messages referencing sources and changes

### Legacy Content Integration Process
1. **Content Assessment:** Determine if content is substantive (concepts, patterns) vs procedural (instructions)
2. **Extract & Integrate:** Pull valuable content into appropriate handbook sections
3. **Update References:** Add source attribution for integrated content
4. **Clean Up:** Remove redundant or outdated content after successful integration
5. **Document Integration:** Update maintenance records with integration details

### Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] **Content Substance:** Content is conceptual/reference material, not procedural instructions
- [ ] **Formatting Standards:** Matches handbook style (tables, code blocks, emojis, diagrams)
