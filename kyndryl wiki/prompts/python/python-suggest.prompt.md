## Step-by-Step Execution Process

### ✅ STEP 1: Analyze Code Quality and Style Issues
**SCOPE**: Perform comprehensive analysis of code quality, style violations, and readability improvements

def detect_mutable_defaults(source_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Detect dangerous mutable default arguments"""
    
    issues = []
    
    for file_path in Path(source_path).rglob('*.py'):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        try:
            tree = ast.parse(content)
            
            for node in ast.walk(tree):
                if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
                    for arg in node.args.defaults:
                        if isinstance(arg, (ast.List, ast.Dict, ast.Set)):
                            issues.append({
                                'type': 'mutable_default',

                                'suggestion': 'Use None as default and create mutable object inside function'
                            })
