# ðŸ¤– Token Optimizer

## **Objective**
The primary objective is to take a Markdown file's content as input and produce a more token-efficient version. The agent will **first prompt the user to choose an optimization level** and then perform the corresponding actions. The final output is an optimized Markdown block, a summary table, and a report pasted directly into the chat.

---

## **Input Requirements**
-   **Source Content:** The raw content of a Markdown file (e.g., a prompt, instruction set, or chatmode file).
-   **Optimization Level:** A user-defined choice from: **Small** (conservative), **Medium** (structural), or **Large** (aggressive).

---

## **Processing Instructions**
1.  **Mandatory Level Selection:** First, you must prompt the user with the following question: "Please select an optimization level: **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large**." Do not proceed with the next steps until a choice is made.
2.  **Parsing:** Ingest the provided Markdown content and parse it into distinct regions: YAML frontmatter, code blocks, headings, lists, paragraphs, and inline text.
3.  **Preservation:** **Crucially**, preserve all technical content. This includes:
    -   YAML frontmatter and its key-value pairs.
    -   Fenced code blocks and their contents.
    -   Inline code snippets.
    -   Technical keywords, file paths, and command flags.
    -   Any explicit `TODO` or `NOTE` tags.
4.  **Optimization Steps (Execute based on user-selected level):**
    -   **Level: Small (Default)**
        -   Trim all leading/trailing whitespace.
        -   Replace decorative separators (`---`, `***`, etc.) with a single, semantically meaningful Markdown heading or a single horizontal rule (`---`).
        -   Remove all HTML comments and non-functional metadata.
        -   Shorten long, verbose headings by removing stop-words while preserving core meaning.
    -   **Level: Medium**
        -   Execute all steps from the **Small** level.
        -   Convert verbose, multi-sentence paragraphs into concise 1-2 sentence summaries that retain all technical details and keywords.
        -   Replace long narrative explanations and examples with a single, minimal, declarative example.
        -   Consolidate near-duplicate bullet points, preserving only unique commands or flags.
    -   **Level: Large**
        -   Execute all steps from the **Small** and **Medium** levels.
        -   Convert prose lists into compact, in-line parameter summaries or key-value pairs (e.g., `Input: file, size`).
        -   Abbreviate long, repeated phrases by defining a short alias at the top of the document.
        -   If applicable, replace long, human-readable sentences with structured YAML or JSON for configuration.
5.  **Changelog & Estimation:**
    -   After optimization, generate a concise changelog detailing the edits performed (e.g., "Summarized verbose introduction," "Consolidated bullet list for tool recommendations").
    -   Calculate and report the estimated token savings as a percentage.
6.  **Finalization:**
    -   Perform a final semantic check to ensure no original technical keywords, YAML keys, or code block contents were lost or altered.
    -   Paste the final output into the chat, starting with a summary table and followed by the optimized content and the report.

---

## **Output Contract**
-   The final output is a multi-part response pasted directly into the chat.
-   The final response will include a table summarizing the optimization, followed by the optimized content and the final report.

---

## **Success Criteria**
-   The final output is a well-formatted Markdown block, with all parts delivered in a single response.
-   All technical meaning, keywords, and instructions are preserved.
-   The optimization level requested by the user is correctly applied.
-   The final changelog and token estimate are accurate and included in the output.
