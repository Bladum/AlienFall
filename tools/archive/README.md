# Tools Archive

## Goal / Purpose

The Archive folder contains deprecated, experimental, or historical tools and scripts. These are kept for reference but are not part of active development.

## Content

- Legacy tools and scripts
- Experimental implementations
- Historical development scripts
- Backup tools
- Previous iterations

## What's Here

Tools in this folder are:
- Superseded by newer tools
- Experimental (not production-ready)
- Historical interest only
- Potential for future revival
- Reference implementations

## Using Archive Tools

Archive tools should:
1. NOT be used in production
2. Only be referenced for historical context
3. Be used as reference for new implementations
4. Be considered for revival if needed
5. Eventually be deleted if truly obsolete

## Reviving Archive Tools

If you need to use an archived tool:
1. Review the original implementation
2. Check if newer version exists
3. Update for current codebase
4. Test thoroughly
5. Move to main tools folder if approved
