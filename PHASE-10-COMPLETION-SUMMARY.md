## Phase 10 Deliverables

### 3 Core Orchestration Modules

#### 1. Campaign Loop Orchestrator (550 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/campaign_orchestrator.lua`

**Purpose:** Central hub coordinating all 10 campaign systems into unified game loop.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
CampaignOrchestrator = {
    systems = {
        mission_outcome,      -- Phase 8
        craft_return,         -- Phase 8
        unit_recovery,        -- Phase 8
        difficulty_escalation,-- Phase 8
        salvage_processor,    -- Phase 8
        alien_research,       -- Phase 9
        base_expansion,       -- Phase 9
        faction_dynamics,     -- Phase 9
        campaign_events,      -- Phase 9
        difficulty_refinements-- Phase 9
    },
    campaignData,             -- Persistent campaign state
    campaign_phase = 1-4,     -- Campaign progression
    mission_history,          -- All missions played
    system_state_log          -- Event tracking
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `startNewCampaign(difficulty, funding, soldiers)` - Initialize campaign
- `updateCampaignDay(days_passed)` - Day progression, update all systems
- `generateNextMission()` - Create mission with all systems integrated
- `processMissionOutcome(result)` - Update campaign from mission results
- `getCampaignStatus()` - UI-ready status snapshot
- `checkCampaignStatus()` - Detect win/loss conditions
- `serialize()` / `deserialize()` - Save/load support

**Campaign Flow:**
```
Start Campaign (Threat 0)
  ↓
Day Update → All Systems Update
  ↓
Generate Mission (with all subsystems)
  ↓
Execute Mission (Battlescape)
  ↓
Process Outcome (feedback to all systems)
  ↓
Check Threat Level / Phase Transitions
  ↓
Repeat until Victory (Threat 100) or Defeat (No soldiers/factions)
```

**System Integration:**
1. **Mission Generation:** Incorporates alien research (unit types), difficulty escalation (enemy count), events (complications), refinements (elite squads/leaders)
2. **Outcome Processing:** Updates outcome processor, craft return, unit recovery, salvage, factions, threat, events
3. **Phase Transitions:** Automatic progression through campaign phases at threat 25/50/75
4. **State Synchronization:** All systems updated in dependency order each day

---

#### 2. UI Integration Layer (380 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/ui_integration_layer.lua`

**Purpose:** Bridges all campaign systems to user interface for real-time display.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
UIIntegrationLayer = {
    visible_panels = {
        top_bar,
        threat_indicator,
        resources,
        alerts
    },
    ui_elements = {},
    notifications = {},
    screen_width,
    screen_height
}
```

**UI Panels:**

1. **Top Status Bar**
   - Days elapsed
   - Current threat level (0-100)
   - Campaign phase (1-4)
   - Monthly funding
   - Win rate (%)

2. **Threat Indicator**

#### 3. Save Game Manager (420 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/save_game_manager.lua`

**Purpose:** Complete serialization/deserialization of campaign state with multiple slots, auto-save, and validation.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
SaveGameManager = {
    save_directory = "temp/saves/",
    max_save_slots = 10,
    auto_save_interval = 5,  -- Days
    save_version = "1.0",
    game_version = "XCOM_Simple_Phase10"
}
```

**Save File Structure:**
- Save file format: `.xcom` (encrypted Lua serialization)
- Location: `temp/saves/save_01.xcom` through `save_10.xcom`
- Auto-save slot: `save_10.xcom` (overwritten every 5 days)
- Metadata: timestamp, game version, threat level, mission count

**Saved Data:**
- Complete orchestrator state
- All 10 system states
- Campaign metrics (threat, missions, soldiers, etc)
- Mission history
- UI state (panels, notifications)

**Key Methods:**
- `saveCampaign(slot, orchestrator, ui_layer)` - Save to numbered slot (1-10)
