## 5 Core Advanced Feature Modules

### 1. Alien Research System (480 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/alien_research_system.lua`

**Purpose:** Tracks alien technology progression as threat increases. Aliens unlock new tech tiers, upgrade unit types, and advance research independently of player actions. Player can discover alien tech from combat to stay competitive.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
AlienResearchSystem = {
    threatLevel,           -- 0-100 threat scale
    alienTechTree = {      -- 9 research nodes across 5 tiers
        tier_1: [3 techs],
        tier_2: [3 techs],
        tier_3: [2 techs],
        tier_4: [2 techs],
        tier_5: [1 tech]
    },
    playerDiscoveredTechs, -- Tech learned from alien engagement
    research completion %  -- 0-100 for each tech
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `updateAlienResearch(days, threat)` - Progress alien research based on threat
- `getAlienUnitComposition()` - Returns available units with stat multipliers
- `recordTechDiscovery(name, unit_type, value)` - Player discovers alien tech
- `getCompletedResearchMilestones()` - Returns completed research tier
- `calculateResearchAdvantage(player_tier)` - Threat vs player tech balance

**Threat-Based Progression:**

### 2. Base Expansion System (420 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/base_expansion_system.lua`

**Purpose:** Manages base growth and infrastructure capacity as campaign progresses. New facilities unlock at threat thresholds, base grid expands (10x10 → 25x25), and supply lines become vulnerable. Larger bases offer more capability but create tactical vulnerabilities.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
BaseExpansionSystem = {
    baseSize = 1-4,        -- 10x10, 15x15, 20x20, 25x25 grids
    facilitiesUnlocked = {},-- Facility unlock state and timing
    infrastructureCapacity = {
        hangar_slots,
        soldier_barracks,
        workshop_capacity,
        laboratory_capacity,
        power_output,
        storage_capacity,
        research_rate,
        defense_rating,
        supply_efficiency
    },
    expansionMilestones = {}-- Tracking expansion history
}
```

**Facilities by Threat Tier:**

| Facility | Threat | Effect | Cost |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Barracks | 0 | +50 soldiers | 500 |
| Hangar | 0 | +2 craft slots | 800 |
| Workshop | 15 | +3 manufacturing | 1200 |
| Laboratory | 15 | +2 research | 1500 |
| Communications | 20 | +20% supply efficiency | 1000 |
| Advanced Lab | 35 | +3 research, +25% rate | 2000 |
| Defense Grid | 35 | +50% defense | 2500 |
| Production | 40 | +5 manufacturing | 2200 |
| Power Plant | 55 | +200 power output | 3500 |
| Vault | 55 | +1000 storage | 3000 |
| Command Center | 70 | +40% research, +30% supply | 5000 |
| Gateway | 80 | +150% defense | 8000 |

**Key Methods:**
- `updateBaseExpansion(threat, days)` - Update base growth

- `addFacility(facility_id, quantity)` - Build facility, update capacity
- `calculateSupplyLineVulnerability()` - 0-1 vulnerability rating
- `getBaseDefenseRating()` - Defense multiplier vs assault
- `getBaseStatus()` - UI-ready base metrics

**Base Size Scaling:**
- **Size 1:** Threat 0-24 (10x10, basic setup)
- **Size 2:** Threat 25-49 (15x15, expanded operations)
- **Size 3:** Threat 50-74 (20x20, advanced infrastructure)
- **Size 4:** Threat 75-100 (25x25, maximum capacity)

**Integration Points:**
1. Threat escalation → Facility unlocks
2. Base size → Supply line vulnerability increases
3. Capacity expansion → Soldier/craft roster limits
4. Defense rating → Base assault probability

### 3. Faction Dynamics System (450 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/faction_dynamics.lua`

**Purpose:** Manages international relations between 9 global powers and player organization. Mission outcomes, strategic choices, and council pressure dynamically affect faction standing. Funding depends on faction relationships. Factions can be lost if standing drops too low.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
FactionDynamicsSystem = {
    factions = {
        united_nations,     -- Government (2.0 influence)
        nato,              -- Military (0.9 influence)
        united_states,     -- Nation (1.2 influence, +12% funding)
        europe,            -- Coalition (0.8 influence)
        russia,            -- Nation (0.9 influence)
        china,             -- Nation (0.9 influence)
        india,             -- Nation (0.6 influence)
        brazil,            -- Nation (0.6 influence)
        security_council   -- Council (2.0 influence)
    },
    factions[faction].standing,    -- -100 to +100
    council_pressure,              -- 0-100 based on threat
    faction_demands = {}           -- Strategic priorities
}
```

**Standing Effects:**
- **+75 to +100:** Faction actively supports, funding +50%
- **+50 to +75:** Faction supportive, funding +25%
- **+25 to +50:** Faction neutral, standard funding
- **0 to +25:** Faction cautious, funding -10%
- **-40 to 0:** Faction dissatisfied, funding -25%
- **-75 to -40:** Faction at risk of abandonment
- **Below -75:** Faction abandons campaign, funding lost permanently

**Council Pressure Scales:**
- Threat 0-25: Pressure 0-20 (research demands)
- Threat 25-50: Pressure 20-40 (interception targets, research)
- Threat 50-75: Pressure 40-60 (combat missions, defense)
- Threat 75-100: Pressure 60-100 (final assault prep)

**Key Methods:**
- `processMissionOutcome(result, favored_faction)` - Update standings
- `updateCouncilPressure(threat, standing)` - Calculate pressure
- `checkFactionStability()` - Identify at-risk/abandoned factions
- `calculateTotalFunding(base)` - Monthly income with multipliers
- `recordStrategicChoice(type, effects)` - Apply choice impacts
- `getFactionStandings()` - Current state for UI

**Strategic Decisions Impact:**

- Intercept UFO → NATO, Russia +5
- Research Alien Tech → China, Russia -10, UN +5
- Withdraw Troops → Russia, China +15, US -20
- International Cooperation → All factions +10

**Integration Points:**
1. Mission success/failure → Faction standing change
2. Council pressure → Mission generation priorities
3. Faction funding → Base monthly revenue (base × multiplier)
4. Strategic choice → Faction relationship shift
5. Standing below -75 → Funding loss, campaign difficulty spike

### 4. Campaign Events System (480 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/campaign_events_system.lua`

**Purpose:** Generates dynamic campaign events based on threat level that create story beats, strategic complications, and narrative hooks. Events trigger special conditions, modify mission parameters, and create cascading effects that extend beyond single missions.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
CampaignEventsSystem = {
    threatLevel,           -- 0-100
    active_events = {},    -- Currently active events
    event_history = {},    -- All triggered events
    event_log = {}         -- Timestamped event records
}
```

**Event Tiers by Threat:**

**Tier 1 (Threat 0-25):** Low-stakes background events
- Civilian Panic (-10% funding, +5 pressure)
- Research Breakthrough (+100 RP, tech unlock)

**Tier 2 (Threat 25-50):** Growing pressure events
- Alien Activity Spike (+50% mission frequency, +1.5x UFO activity)
- Base Security Breach (-20% defense, infiltration risk)

**Tier 3 (Threat 50-75):** Critical decision points
- Council Demands Intervention (+30 pressure, mandatory missions, +500 cr funding)
- Alien Leadership Emergence (+20 threat, elite units, research urgency)

**Tier 4 (Threat 75-100):** Existential threat events
- Global Meltdown Risk (+50 pressure, diplomatic crisis, 30-day deadline)
- Dimensional Gateway Detected (+30 threat, reinforcement wave, final phase)

**Event Probability Scaling:**
```
adjusted_probability = base_probability × (1 + threat_factor × 0.5)
trigger_roll = random() < (adjusted_probability × days_passed / 30)
```

**Event Complications:**
- `time_pressure` - Reduce mission turns to 75%
- `increased_casualties` - Apply casualty penalty
- `elite_enemies` - Upgrade enemy tier +2
- `reinforcements` - Add enemy reinforcements mid-mission
- `limited_resources` - Supply limited to 50%
- `diplomatic_crisis` - Diplomatic weight ×2
- `research_urgency` - Research rate bonus
- `factional_conflict` - Faction relationship impacts

**Key Methods:**
- `generateEvents(threat, days_passed)` - Trigger threat-appropriate events
- `getActiveEvents()` - UI-ready active event list
- `applyMissionComplication(type, mission)` - Modify mission parameters
- `resolveEvent(id, resolution)` - Mark event complete
- `checkCascadingEvents(event)` - Trigger follow-up events
- `getEventStatistics()` - Campaign event summary

**Cascading Events:**
- Alien Leadership Emergence → Elite Squad Deployment
- Base Security Breach → Counter-Intelligence Investigation
- Global Meltdown Risk → International Cooperation (funding boost)

**Integration Points:**
1. Threat escalation → Event generation
2. Event trigger → Mission complication application
3. Event resolution → Cascading event check
4. Active events → UI notifications
5. Council pressure → Event frequency

### 5. Difficulty Refinements System (410 lines)
**File:** `engine/geoscape/difficulty_refinements.lua`

**Purpose:** Advanced difficulty mechanics beyond stat multipliers. Creates alien leader emergence at high threat, strategic alien deployment patterns, psychological pressure on player units, and elite squad tactics. Delivers challenging late-game escalation.

**Key Architecture:**
```lua
DifficultyRefinementsSystem = {
    threatLevel,           -- 0-100
    alienLeader = {        -- May emerge at threat 70+
        name,
        health,
        psi_power,
        control_range,
        abilities = {}
    },
    eliteSquads = {},      -- Available at different threat tiers
    psychological_pressure,-- 0-100, affects player morale
    tactical_depth = 1-5,  -- Alien AI sophistication
    morale_effects = {}    -- Penalties from pressure
}
```

**Alien Leaders:**

| Leader | Threat | Emergence | Health | Psi Power | Abilities | Morale Penalty |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Sectoid Commander | 70 | Threat 70+ | 2.0× | 1.8× | Mind Control, Psionic Lance, Coordination, Awareness | -20 |
| Ethereal Supreme | 85 | Threat 85+ | 3.0× | 2.5× | Mass Mind Control, Psionic Storm, Rift, Resurrection, Reality Distortion | -50 |

**Elite Squad Composition:**

| Tier | Threat | Squad | Composition |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Veteran | 40+ | elite_1 | 3× Muton(vet), 2× Sectoid(1) | 0.3-0.6 deploy weight |
| Expert | 55+ | elite_2 | 1× Ethereal(3), 2× Muton(2), 2× Sectoid(2) | 0.2-0.65 deploy weight |
| Commander | 70+ | elite_3 | 2× Ethereal(3), 2× Muton Elite(3), 1× Sectoid(2) | 0.1-0.7 deploy weight |
| Supreme | 85+ | elite_4 | 1× Alien Leader(5), 2× Ethereal(4), 2× Muton Elite(4) | 0.05-0.8 deploy weight |

**Psychological Pressure Calculation:**
```lua
base_pressure = threat × 0.7
if win_rate < 40%: pressure × 1.5
if win_rate < 50%: pressure × 1.2
if recent_casualties > 10: pressure += casualties × 0.5
```

**Morale Effects from Pressure:**
- Leadership penalty: pressure / 100
- Accuracy penalty: pressure × 0.3 / 100
- Damage penalty: pressure × 0.2 / 100
- Armor penalty: pressure × 0.1 / 100
- Panic chance: pressure × 0.1 / 100

**Tactical Depth Levels:**

| Depth | Threat | Tactics | AI Modifier |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | <30 | Direct engagement | 1.0× |
| 2 | 30-50 | Flanking, focus fire | 1.15× |
| 3 | 50-70 | Cover usage, coordination | 1.35× |
| 4 | 70-85 | Psychological warfare, ambushes | 1.65× |
| 5 | 85-100 | Perfect coordination, adaptive | 2.0× |

**Key Methods:**
- `updateDifficultyRefinements(threat, performance)` - Update all systems
- `getMoraleEffects()` - Current morale penalties
- `getEliteSquadDeployment()` - Select squad based on probability
- `getAlienLeaderStatus()` - Leader info or nil
- `applyPsychologicalModifiers(stats)` - Apply morale to unit stats
- `getTacticalDifficultyModifier()` - Overall difficulty multiplier

**Integration Points:**
1. Threat 70 → Sectoid Commander emerges, morale penalty applied
2. Threat 85 → Ethereal Supreme emerges, psychological pressure massive
3. Psychological pressure → Mission morale penalties
4. Tactical depth → Alien AI behavior complexity
5. Player performance → Pressure scaling (losing increases pressure)
