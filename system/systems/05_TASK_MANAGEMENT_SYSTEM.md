# Task Management System
**Pattern: File-Based Work Tracking with State Transitions**

**Purpose:** Track work transparently using version-controlled markdown files  
**Problem Solved:** Opaque project boards, lost context, disconnected from code, work becomes invisible  
**Universal Pattern:** Applicable to any project requiring lightweight, transparent task management

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Principle:** Tasks are markdown files that move through states, living alongside the code they describe.

```
STATE 1: TODO (Planned)
    ↓ start work
STATE 2: In Progress (Active)
    ↓ complete
STATE 3: DONE (Completed)

All tracked in version control
All linked to code changes
All searchable and referenceable
All visible to entire team
```

**Key Rules:**
- One task = one file
- Task state = file location
- All in git (version controlled)
- Linked to commits (traceability)

**Why This Works:**
- **Transparency:** Anyone can see all work
- **Context:** Task lives near the code it describes
- **Traceability:** Git history shows task evolution
- **Searchability:** grep/find work on markdown files
- **Simplicity:** No external tools required

---

## 📊 System Architecture

### Component 1: Task File Structure

**Purpose:** Standardized format for all tasks

**Location:** `tasks/TODO/FEATURE_NAME.md` or `tasks/DONE/FEATURE_NAME.md`

**Complete Template:**
```markdown

## Related Files
- **Design:** design/mechanics/[System].md
- **API:** api/[SYSTEM].md
- **Architecture:** architecture/systems/[system].md
- **Engine:** engine/[path]/[file].lua
- **Tests:** tests2/[path]/[file]_test.lua

---

**Status:** 🟡 TODO
**Next Action:** [What to do next]
**Assigned To:** [Person if applicable]
```

**Input:** Work requirements from team/stakeholders  
**Output:** Structured task document  
**Validation:** Template completeness check

---

### Component 2: State Machine

**Purpose:** Define task lifecycle and valid transitions

**States:**
```
┌─────────┐
│  TODO   │ ← Tasks not yet started (planned)
└────┬────┘
     │ start work
     ▼
┌─────────┐
│In Progress│ ← Active work being done
└────┬────┘
     │ complete
     ▼
┌─────────┐
│  DONE   │ ← Finished tasks (archived)
└─────────┘

Alternative paths:
TODO → BLOCKED (dependencies not met, external blocker)
BLOCKED → TODO (unblocked, can resume)
In Progress → TODO (paused, priorities changed)
```

**Valid Transitions:**
```
TODO → In Progress:
  Action: Start work on task
  Update: Change status emoji to 🟠
  Log: Add "Started: YYYY-MM-DD" to progress log
  File: Stays in tasks/TODO/ (work in progress)

In Progress → DONE:
  Action: Complete all objectives
  Update: Change status emoji to 🟢
  Log: Add "Completed: YYYY-MM-DD" to progress log
  File: Move from tasks/TODO/ to tasks/DONE/
  Metrics: Log actual vs estimated effort

Any → BLOCKED:
  Action: External blocker encountered
  Update: Change status emoji to 🔴
  Log: Document blocking issue and expected resolution
  Dependencies: Update with blocking task/issue

BLOCKED → TODO:
  Action: Blocker resolved
  Update: Change status emoji back to 🟡
  Log: Document how blocker was resolved
```

**Input:** State change trigger (manual or automated)  
**Output:** Updated task file and optional location change  
**Validation:** Only valid state transitions allowed

---

### Component 3: Task Tracker

**Purpose:** Overview of all tasks and project health

**Implementation:**
```bash
# List all tasks by state
ls tasks/TODO/     # Planned and in-progress tasks
ls tasks/DONE/     # Completed tasks

# Find tasks by priority
grep -r "Priority: CRITICAL" tasks/TODO/

# Find tasks by category
grep -r "Category: Bug" tasks/TODO/

# Find blocked tasks
grep -r "Status: 🔴 Blocked" tasks/TODO/

# Track progress
total_todo=$(ls tasks/TODO/ | wc -l)
total_done=$(ls tasks/DONE/ | wc -l)
completion_rate=$((total_done * 100 / (total_todo + total_done)))
echo "Completion: $completion_rate%"
```

**Automated Reporter:**
```lua
-- tools/task/report.lua

function TaskReporter:generateReport()
    local report = {
        total = 0,
        by_status = {},
        by_priority = {},
        by_category = {},
        blocked = {},
        stale = {}
    }
    
    -- Scan all task files
    for _, file in ipairs(FileScanner:findTasks("tasks/")) do
        local task = TaskParser:parse(file)
        
        report.total = report.total + 1
        report.by_status[task.status] = (report.by_status[task.status] or 0) + 1
        report.by_priority[task.priority] = (report.by_priority[task.priority] or 0) + 1
        report.by_category[task.category] = (report.by_category[task.category] or 0) + 1
        
        if task.status == "BLOCKED" then
            table.insert(report.blocked, task)
        end
        
        if task.last_update_days > 30 then
            table.insert(report.stale, task)
        end
    end
    
    return report
end
```

**Input:** Task files in filesystem  
**Output:** Status overview and metrics  
**Pattern:** File system as database

---

### Component 4: Dependency Manager

**Purpose:** Track and visualize task dependencies

**Data Structure:**
```
TASK_A (Implement API)
  └─ blocks → TASK_B (Implement Engine)
      └─ blocks → TASK_C (Create Content)
          └─ blocks → TASK_D (Write Tests)

Dependency chain: A → B → C → D
Work order: Must complete A before B, B before C, C before D
```

**Validation Tool:**
```bash
tools/validators/task_dependencies.lua tasks/

# Checks:
# 1. Circular dependencies (A blocks B blocks A)
# 2. Missing dependencies (references non-existent task)
# 3. Broken chains (dependency deleted but reference remains)
# 4. Topological sort (determine valid work order)
```

**Dependency Graph Generator:**
```lua
function DependencyGraph:generate(task_dir)
    local graph = {}
    
    -- Build dependency graph
    for _, task_file in ipairs(FileScanner:findTasks(task_dir)) do
        local task = TaskParser:parse(task_file)
        graph[task.id] = {
            depends_on = task.dependencies.depends_on or {},
            blocks = task.dependencies.blocks or {},
            related = task.dependencies.related or {}
        }
    end
    
    -- Generate Mermaid diagram
    local mermaid = "graph TD\n"
    for task_id, deps in pairs(graph) do
        for _, blocked_task in ipairs(deps.blocks) do
            mermaid = mermaid .. "  " .. task_id .. " --> " .. blocked_task .. "\n"
        end
    end
    
    return mermaid
end
```

**Input:** Dependency declarations in task files  
**Output:** Dependency graph, validation results, work order  
**Pattern:** Topological sort for determining completion order

## 🔄 Task Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating a Task

```
Step 1: Identify Work
  └─ New feature requested, bug found, improvement needed

Step 2: Create Task File
  └─ cp tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md tasks/TODO/IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM.md

Step 3: Fill Template
  ├─ Set priority (based on urgency/impact matrix)
  ├─ Estimate effort (hours/days/weeks, T-shirt sizes)
  ├─ Define objectives (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
  ├─ Plan phases (logical breakdown of work)
  ├─ List dependencies (what must complete first)
  └─ Define success criteria (how we know it's done)

Step 4: Review
  ├─ Is scope clear and bounded?
  ├─ Is estimate reasonable (compare to similar tasks)?
  ├─ Are dependencies identified correctly?
  ├─ Are success criteria measurable?
  └─ Team consensus on priority?

Step 5: Commit to Git
  └─ git add tasks/TODO/IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM.md
      git commit -m "task: plan pilot system implementation"
      git push origin main
```

**Best Practices:**
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks (<1 week effort)
- Link to relevant design/API docs in Related Files
- Include "why" context in Overview section
- Define clear, measurable success criteria

---

### Workflow 2: Working on a Task

```
Step 1: Start Task
  ├─ Update status: 🟡 TODO → 🟠 In Progress
  ├─ Add start date to progress log
  └─ Note initial approach and plan

Step 2: Track Progress Daily
  ├─ Check off completed subtasks (check boxes)
  ├─ Update progress log with milestones
  ├─ Document decisions made (and why)
  └─ Note any blockers encountered

Step 3: Link to Code
  ├─ Reference task in commit messages:
  │   git commit -m "feat(pilot): add skill system (ref: IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM)"
  ├─ Update "Related Files" section with affected files
  └─ Keep task synchronized with actual work

Step 4: Handle Blockers
  If blocked:
    ├─ Change status: 🟠 In Progress → 🔴 Blocked
    ├─ Document blocking issue in detail
    ├─ Update Dependencies section
    ├─ Notify team (blocking might affect schedule)
    └─ Work on different task while blocked

Step 5: Stay Updated
  ├─ Update progress log at least weekly
  ├─ Keep objectives/subtasks current
  └─ Adjust estimates if scope changes
```

**Best Practices:**
- Small, frequent commits referencing the task
- Daily progress updates (even if just "continued work on X")
- Document "why" decisions were made
- Communicate blockers immediately

---

### Workflow 3: Completing a Task

```
Step 1: Verify Success Criteria
  ├─ Review checklist: All objectives met?
  ├─ Check: Success criteria satisfied?
  ├─ Verify: Tests written and passing?
  ├─ Confirm: Documentation updated?
  └─ Validate: Code reviewed and approved?

Step 2: Update Task
  ├─ Change status: 🟠 In Progress → 🟢 DONE
  ├─ Add completion date to progress log
  ├─ Document actual vs estimated effort
  ├─ Note lessons learned (what went well/poorly)
  └─ Celebrate completion!

Step 3: Move File
  └─ mv tasks/TODO/IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM.md tasks/DONE/

Step 4: Commit Changes
  └─ git add tasks/
      git commit -m "task: complete pilot system implementation"
      git push origin main

Step 5: Unblock Dependents
  ├─ Find tasks blocked by this one (grep "Depends on: TASK_NAME")
  ├─ Update their status if now unblocked
  └─ Notify team that dependent work can begin

Step 6: Archive and Metrics
  ├─ Task automatically archived in DONE/
  ├─ Metrics tracked (completion rate, velocity, accuracy)
  └─ Available for retrospectives and planning
```

**Best Practices:**
- Don't skip verification steps
- Document lessons learned (improve future estimates)
- Update dependent tasks promptly
- Archive provides historical reference

          path: task_report.txt
```

---

## ✅ Validation Rules

### Rule 1: Template Completeness

**Check:** All required fields filled

```bash
tools/validators/task_validator.lua tasks/TODO/

# Required fields:
# - Priority (must be: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW)
# - Category (must be valid category)
# - Estimated Effort (must have value)
# - Objectives (at least 1 defined)
# - Success Criteria (at least 1 defined)
```

**Violations:**
- Missing priority
- No objectives defined
- Empty success criteria
- No estimated effort

**Fix:** Complete all required template sections

---

### Rule 2: Dependency Validity

**Check:** All dependencies exist and are valid

```bash
tools/validators/task_dependencies.lua tasks/

# Checks:
# - Referenced tasks exist (not deleted or typo)
# - No circular dependencies (A → B → A)
# - Dependency states logical (can't depend on DONE task as prerequisite)
# - Topological order possible (can determine completion sequence)
```

**Violations:**
- Depends on non-existent task: "IMPLEMENT_MISSING_FEATURE"
- Circular dependency: TASK_A depends on TASK_B, TASK_B depends on TASK_A
- Broken reference: Depends on task that was deleted

**Fix:** Update dependencies to reference valid tasks, break circular dependencies

---

### Rule 3: Status Consistency

**Check:** Status matches file location

```bash
tools/validators/task_status.lua tasks/

# Rules:
# - Files in TODO/ must have status: TODO, In Progress, or Blocked
# - Files in DONE/ must have status: DONE
# - Status emoji matches text status
```

**Violations:**
- File in TODO/ with status: DONE (should be in DONE/)
- File in DONE/ with status: In Progress (not actually done!)
- Status emoji 🟡 but text says "In Progress" (mismatch)

**Fix:** Move file to correct location, update status consistently

---

### Rule 4: Progress Currency

**Check:** Active tasks have recent updates

```bash
tools/validators/task_activity.lua tasks/TODO/

# Rules:
# - In Progress tasks: updated within 7 days
# - TODO tasks: updated within 30 days
# - BLOCKED tasks: have blocker documented
```

**Violations:**
- In Progress task not updated in 2 weeks (stale? abandoned?)
- TODO task created 6 months ago, never started (obsolete?)
- BLOCKED task with no blocker description

**Fix:** Update stale tasks, archive obsolete tasks, document blockers

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Vague Objectives

**WRONG:**
```markdown
## Objectives
- [ ] Make it better
- [ ] Fix the issues
- [ ] Improve performance
```

**RIGHT:**
```markdown
## Objectives
- [ ] Add pilot skill_level property with range [0-100]
- [ ] Implement skill gain: +1 skill per 10 flight hours
- [ ] Apply skill bonus to craft performance (skill/100 multiplier to dodge)
```

**Why:** Specific objectives enable verification and progress tracking.

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: No Success Criteria

**WRONG:**
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature works
```

**RIGHT:**
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] Pilots gain skill through flight hours (verified in tests)
- [ ] Skilled pilots provide measurable bonuses (10% at skill 100)
- [ ] UI displays pilot skill and progression
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration, >75% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated (design, API, architecture)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by 2 team members
```

**Why:** Clear criteria prevent scope creep, enable objective completion verification.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Monolithic Tasks

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# TASK: Implement Entire Combat System

**Estimated Effort:** 6 months

## Objectives
- [ ] Units
- [ ] Combat mechanics
- [ ] AI behavior
- [ ] Balancing
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Animations
- ... (50 more items)
```

**RIGHT:**
```markdown
# TASK: Implement Unit Entity

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

## Objectives
- [ ] Create Unit class with core properties
- [ ] Implement basic methods (move, attack, defend)
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests (>75% coverage)
- [ ] Document in API (api/UNITS.md)

Dependencies: None
Blocks: IMPLEMENT_COMBAT_RESOLVER, IMPLEMENT_AI, IMPLEMENT_UI
```

**Why:** Small tasks are estimable, trackable, and completable. Break large tasks into chains of smaller tasks.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Disconnected from Code

**WRONG:**
```markdown
# Task exists in tasks/
# Code changes happen in multiple PRs
# Never linked together
# Task and code drift apart, no traceability
```

**RIGHT:**
```markdown
# Commit messages reference task:
git commit -m "feat(units): add pilot system (ref: IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM)"

# Task references commits:
## Progress Log
### 2025-10-20
- Implemented pilot attributes (commit abc123)
- Added skill progression logic (commit def456)
- Created UI for pilot display (commit 789ghi)

# PR description links task:
Closes: tasks/TODO/IMPLEMENT_PILOT_SYSTEM.md
```

**Why:** Bidirectional links enable traceability and context.

---

dot -Tpng tasks.dot -o task_dependencies.png

# Generates visual dependency graph showing:
# - Task nodes
# - Dependency arrows
# - Color-coded by status (TODO=yellow, In Progress=orange, DONE=green)
# - Critical path highlighted
```

---

## 📊 System Health Metrics

### Metric 1: Task Throughput

**Targets:**
```
Tasks completed per week: 5-10
Average task duration: 2-5 days
Estimation accuracy: ±30% (actual vs estimated)
```

Stale tasks (>30 days no update): 0
Blocked tasks: <3
```

**Measurement:**
```bash
lua tools/reports/task_health.lua

# Current status:
# - TODO: 15 ✓
# - In Progress: 5 ✓
# - Stale: 0 ✓
# - Blocked: 2 ✓
```

---

### Metric 3: Priority Distribution

# - Reopened: 2 (4%) ✓
```

---

## 🌍 Universal Adaptation

### Pattern in Different Project Types

**Software Development** (Current Implementation):
- Tasks = Features, bugs, refactors, documentation
- States = TODO / In Progress / DONE
- Links = Code commits, PRs, branches

**Content Production:**
- Tasks = Articles, videos, designs, campaigns
- States = Draft / Review / Published
- Links = Content files, asset folders

**Research Projects:**
- Tasks = Experiments, analyses, papers
- States = Planned / Running / Complete
- Links = Data files, notebooks, publications

**Business Projects:**
- Tasks = Initiatives, campaigns, projects
- States = Planning / Execution / Complete
- Links = Documents, spreadsheets, reports

**Key Insight:** File-based tracking works for any domain. Adapt names and categories to your context.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Task management system is working correctly when:

✅ **Visibility:** All work tracked in tasks (no invisible/shadow work)  
✅ **Synchronization:** Task states reflect reality accurately  
✅ **Clarity:** Dependencies clear and properly managed  
✅ **Traceability:** Tasks linked to code changes bidirectionally  
✅ **Transparency:** Progress visible to all stakeholders  
✅ **Completion:** High completion rate (>90% of started tasks finish)  
✅ **Currency:** No stale tasks (all updated regularly)  
✅ **Health:** Sustainable workload (not too many In Progress)
