# Supporting Infrastructure System
**Pattern: Temporary Files, Automation Scripts, and Meta-Documentation**

**Purpose:** Provide operational utilities supporting the main pipeline  
**Problem Solved:** Cluttered working files, manual commands, undocumented structure  
**Universal Pattern:** Applicable to any project needing developer ergonomics

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept

```
MAIN PIPELINE (Core)
Design â†’ API â†’ Architecture â†’ Engine â†’ Mods â†’ Tests

SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE (Enablers)
â”œâ”€ temp/ (Working space)
â”œâ”€ run/ (Automation scripts)
â””â”€ docs/ (Meta-documentation)

Support enables creation without creating artifacts
```

**Key Rule:** Supporting systems are transient helpers, not permanent artifacts.

## ðŸ“Š Three Support Systems

### System 1: temp/
**Purpose:** Sandboxed space for analysis and transient work  
**Characteristics:** Transient, descriptive names, partially versioned, cleanup policy  
**Usage:** Gap analysis, benchmarks, working drafts

### System 2: run/
**Purpose:** Convenient shortcuts for common development tasks  
**Characteristics:** Platform-specific, documented, error handling  
**Examples:** run_game, run_tests_all, run_validate_*

### System 3: docs/
**Purpose:** Document the documentation system  
**Location:** README, ORGANIZATION, 8 system patterns  
**Characteristics:** System-focused, replicable, universal

---

## âœ… Validation Rules

- temp/ clean (<30 days old)
- run/ complete (all common tasks)
- docs/ current (<6 months old)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

âœ… temp/ stays clean  
âœ… Scripts work reliably  
âœ… Docs explain system  
âœ… New developers find help  
âœ… Infrastructure enables  
âœ… Overhead minimal (<5%)
