- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Love2D console available (`lovec` command works)
- [ ] VS Code ready for testing
- [ ] 5-10 hours available (distributed or consecutive)
- [ ] Team is notified

### Git Safety (5 minutes)

- [ ] Create work branch: `git checkout -b engine-restructure`
- [ ] Create backup branch: `git branch migration-backup`
- [ ] Verify branches created: `git branch`
- [ ] On engine-restructure branch now

### Environment Setup (5 minutes)

- [ ] PowerShell available
- [ ] Project root location: `c:\Users\tombl\Documents\Projects`
- [ ] Scripts exist: `migrate/` folder has 8 .ps1 files
- [ ] Documentation exists: root folder has guides

---

## üöÄ RUNNING THE MIGRATION

### Option 1: Full Automated (Recommended)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\tombl\Documents\Projects
.\migrate\RunAllMigrationSteps.ps1
```

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

- [ ] Scripts run to completion
- [ ] All 7 phases execute
- [ ] No errors occur
- [ ] Validation passes

### Option 2: Dry-Run First (Safer)

```powershell
# Preview what WILL happen
.\migrate\RunAllMigrationSteps.ps1 -DryRun
```

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

- [ ] Run dry-run mode
- [ ] Review output
- [ ] No changes made
- [ ] Confident about migration
- [ ] Then run without -DryRun

### Option 3: Step-by-Step (Most Control)

```powershell
# Run each phase individually
.\migrate\1_PrepareMigration.ps1
# Review output...
.\migrate\2_CopyFilesToNewStructure.ps1
# Review output...
# [Continue with phases 3-7]
```

**Time: 30-60 minutes total**

- [ ] Phase 1: Validate structure
- [ ] Phase 2: Copy files (old folders still exist)
- [ ] Phase 3: Update engine imports
- [ ] Phase 4: Update test imports
- [ ] Phase 5: Reorganize mock data
- [ ] Phase 6: Delete old directories
- [ ] Phase 7: Validate success
