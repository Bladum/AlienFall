## High Priority Guides

These guides fill critical gaps in the current documentation and should be created first.

### 1. SAVE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md

**Why Needed:** Save/load systems are critical for strategy games and complex to implement correctly.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Save file format (JSON vs binary vs TOML)
- Serialization patterns for ECS entities
- Save versioning and migration
- Ironman mode implementation
- Cloud save integration
- Corruption recovery strategies
- Performance optimization (delta saves, compression)
- Testing save/load roundtrips

**Related Systems:**
- ECS persistence
- World state serialization
- Mod compatibility in saves
- Campaign progression tracking

**Code Examples:**
```lua
-- Serializing game state
local SaveManager = require('core.save_manager')
SaveManager:saveGame("campaign_001", {
    world = worldState,
    bases = baseManager:serialize(),
    units = unitRegistry:serialize(),
    research = researchTree:serialize()
})

-- Handling save migrations
SaveManager:registerMigration("1.0.0", "1.1.0", function(oldData)
    -- Migrate old save format to new
    oldData.newField = "default_value"
    return oldData
end)
```

---

### 2. STATE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md

**Why Needed:** Managing game state across Geoscape, Battlescape, and Basescape is complex.

**Topics to Cover:**
- State machine architecture
- Screen/scene transitions
- State persistence between screens
- Pause/resume mechanics
- State stack management (modal dialogs, menus)
- Event-driven state changes
- Debugging state transitions
- Testing state machines

**Patterns:**
- Hierarchical State Machines (HSM)
- Pushdown Automata for UI states
- Command pattern for state changes
- Memento pattern for undo/redo

**Code Examples:**
```lua
-- State machine with enter/exit/update
local GameStateMachine = class('GameStateMachine')

function GameStateMachine:transitionTo(newState, ...)
    if self.currentState then
        self.currentState:exit()
    end
    
    self.previousState = self.currentState
    self.currentState = newState
    self.currentState:enter(...)
end

-- Pushdown state stack for modals
function StateStack:push(state)
    if self.current then
        self.current:pause()
    end
    table.insert(self.stack, state)
    state:enter()
end
```

### 3. DATA_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md

**Why Needed:** TOML data validation is mentioned but not documented in detail.

- Cross-reference validation (foreign keys)
- Circular dependency detection
- Validation error reporting
- Performance of validation
- Custom validation rules

**Use Cases:**
- Mod content validation on load
- Asset reference validation
- Balance checking (damage ranges, costs)
- Research prerequisite validation

**Code Examples:**
```lua
-- Schema-based validation
local ValidationSchema = {
    item = {
        required = {"id", "name", "type"},
        fields = {
            id = {type = "string", pattern = "^[a-z_]+$"},
            name = {type = "string", min_length = 3},
            type = {type = "enum", values = {"weapon", "armor", "item"}},
            cost = {type = "number", min = 0, optional = true}
        }
    }
}

-- Cross-reference validation
local function validateReferences(data, registry)
    for _, item in ipairs(data.items) do
        if item.required_tech then
            assert(registry:hasTech(item.required_tech),
                "Item " .. item.id .. " references unknown tech: " .. item.required_tech)
        end
    end
end
```

### 4. TESTING_GUIDE.md

**Why Needed:** Test framework exists but testing patterns aren't documented.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Unit testing with test_framework.lua
- Integration testing patterns
- Mocking services and dependencies

- Testing UI widgets
- Performance regression tests
- Test organization and naming
- Continuous integration setup

**Test Types:**

- Integration tests (multiple systems)
- End-to-end tests (full gameplay scenarios)

**Code Examples:**
```lua
-- Testing with mocked RNG
local function testCombatDeterminism()
    local mockRNG = MockRNG:new(12345) -- Seeded RNG
    local combat = CombatSystem:new({rng = mockRNG})
    
    local damage = combat:calculateDamage(attacker, defender)
    assert(damage == 25, "Expected deterministic damage of 25")
end

-- Testing ECS components
local function testHealthComponent()
    local entity = Entity:new()
    entity:addComponent(HealthComponent:new(100))
    
    entity:getComponent(HealthComponent):takeDamage(30)
    assert(entity:getComponent(HealthComponent):getHealth() == 70)
end
```

### 5. ECS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

**Why Needed:** ECS is mentioned throughout but not thoroughly documented.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Entity Component System architecture
- Entity lifecycle (create, update, destroy)
- Component design patterns
- System implementation patterns
- Entity queries and filters
- Component communication
- Performance optimization
- Common pitfalls

**Design Patterns:**
- Pure components (data only, no logic)
- Systems operate on component combinations
- Entity as ID vs Entity as container
- Component pooling

**Code Examples:**
```lua
-- Entity creation with components
local soldier = Entity:new()
soldier:addComponent(PositionComponent:new(10, 20))
soldier:addComponent(HealthComponent:new(100))
soldier:addComponent(StatsComponent:new({aim = 65, will = 50}))
soldier:addComponent(InventoryComponent:new())

-- System processes entities with specific components
local MovementSystem = class('MovementSystem', System)

function MovementSystem:update(dt)
    -- Query entities with Position + Movement components
    local entities = self.world:getEntitiesWith('PositionComponent', 'MovementComponent')
    
    for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do
        local pos = entity:getComponent(PositionComponent)
        local move = entity:getComponent(MovementComponent)
        
        pos.x = pos.x + move.velocityX * dt
        pos.y = pos.y + move.velocityY * dt
    end
end
```
