# Alien Fall - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Core Game Design Principles
- **Pixel Art Game**: This is an old-school pixel art game, NOT a mobile game
- **Fixed Resolution**: Core resolution is 800x600 - ALL UI elements must be designed for this resolution
- **Grid System**: Use 20x20 pixel grid system - ALL widgets and UI elements MUST align to this grid
- **No Scaling**: UI is fixed at 800x600, scaling is only for display (window resizing/fullscreen)

### Development Workflow Requirements
- **Always Check Love2D API**: Reference [Love API Reference](https://love2d-community.github.io/love-api/) for accurate function signatures and parameters
- **Console Testing**: Always run the app with console enabled (`t.console = true` in conf.lua) to catch errors and debug output
- **Grid Alignment**: Every UI element position and size must be multiples of 20 pixels (grid units)
- **Instant Scene Switching**: No fancy transitions - use instant scene switches for desktop gaming

### Technical Specifications
- **Resolution**: 800x600 internal resolution (40x30 grid units)
- **Antialiasing**: Disabled (MSAA = 0) for crisp pixel art
- **Filtering**: Nearest-neighbor filtering for pixel-perfect scaling
- **Window**: Resizable with fullscreen support (F11 toggle)
- **Input**: Mouse coordinates automatically converted from window space to 800x600 internal space

## Project Overview

### What is Alien Fall?
Alien Fall is an XCOM-inspired turn-based strategy game built with Love2D and Lua. The project is currently in the design phase with comprehensive documentation - **no implementation code exists yet**. The goal is to create a modern, moddable strategy game that combines strategic world management with tactical combat, featuring deterministic AI systems and extensive customization capabilities.

### Project Goal
The primary objective is to develop a complete, playable strategy game that serves as both an engaging player experience and a technical showcase for Love2D game development. The game aims to demonstrate advanced AI systems, modding infrastructure, and scalable architecture while maintaining performance and extensibility.

### Key Modules
- **ECS Framework**: Entity Component System for game object management
- **World System**: Multi-world geoscape with interconnected regions
- **Mission System**: Dynamic mission generation and management
- **Unit System**: Character progression and equipment management
- **Combat Engine**: Tactical battlescape resolution
- **Economy System**: Resource management and production
- **Mod System**: Comprehensive modding with dependency resolution
- **AI Systems**: Deterministic AI for strategic and tactical gameplay

## Development Guidelines

### UI and Grid System Requirements
- **20x20 Grid System**: ALL UI elements must align to 20x20 pixel grid units
- **Grid Constants**: Use `GRID_SIZE = 20` and calculate positions as `grid_unit * GRID_SIZE`
- **Fixed UI Resolution**: Design all UI for 800x600 (40x30 grid units) - no dynamic UI scaling
- **Pixel Perfect**: Disable antialiasing, use nearest-neighbor filtering for pixel art
- **Window Scaling**: Only the display scales up - UI coordinates remain in 800x600 space

### Naming Conventions
- **snake_case**: Variables and functions (`calculate_damage`, `unit_stats`)
- **PascalCase**: Classes and modules (`MissionSystem`, `UnitEntity`)
- **UPPER_CASE**: Constants (`MAX_HEALTH`, `TILE_SIZE`)

### File Structure Standards
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ ecs/           # Entity Component System implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ systems/       # Game systems (missions, combat, economy)
