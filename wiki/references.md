## Geoscape Layer References

### Europa Universalis IV (Paradox Interactive)
**Province-Based World Map**: AlienFall uses a node graph system similar to grand strategy games.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- **2D world divided into provinces** (not a continuous globe)
- **Provinces as graph nodes** with connections between them
- **Territory control mechanics** (influence over regions)

- **Strategic resource management** across territories

**What AlienFall Changes:**
- Real-time with pause instead of turn-based
- Focus on alien invasion instead of historical simulation
- Simplified diplomacy (funding nations, not alliances)

**Example:** Crafts and UFOs operate **only within provinces**, not in transit between them. This is similar to how armies in EU4 exist in provinces, not in the space between.

## Battlescape Layer References

### Traditional Roguelikes (Nethack, DCSS, ADOM)
**Squad-Based Roguelike Combat**: The battlescape looks more like a **squad-based roguelike** than traditional X-COM.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- **Procedurally generated tactical maps** (every mission is different)
- **Destructible terrain** and environmental interactions
- **ASCII or tile-based aesthetics** (16x16 tiles upscaled to 32x32)
- **Permanent consequences** (unit death is permanent)
- **Emergent tactical situations** from procedural generation

## Combat System References

### Classic X-COM (1994)
**Time Units**: The foundation of action points.

**What AlienFall Changes:**
- **No Time Units (TU)** → **Action Points (AP) + Speed system**
- **No ammunition** → **Energy-based weapon system**

**Differences Explained:**

#### Action Points vs Time Units
**Classic X-COM TU System:**
- Single resource pool (Time Units)
- Every action costs TU: moving, shooting, reloading, turning
- Units with high TU can do more of everything

**AlienFall AP + Speed System:**
- **Action Points (AP)**: Used for combat actions (shooting, reloading, grenades, abilities)
- **Speed stat**: Determines movement range separately
- **Movement** costs are based on Speed, not AP
- This creates clearer separation between mobility and combat capability
- Fast units can move far but may have limited shooting
- Slow units might be immobile but can perform many combat actions

**Example:**
- Classic X-COM: A unit with 60 TU can move 10 tiles (6 TU each) OR shoot 3 times (20 TU each)
- AlienFall: A unit with 4 AP and 10 Speed can move 10 tiles AND shoot 2 times (2 AP each)

#### Energy vs Ammunition
**Classic X-COM:**
- Weapons use physical ammunition
- Must carry clips and reload
- Limited by inventory weight and supply

**AlienFall:**
- **Weapons draw from energy reserves** (battery/power cell)
- **No ammo management** during missions
- **Recharging weapons** instead of reloading clips
- Eliminates mid-mission ammo scarcity
- Focus shifts to tactical positioning and ability usage

**References:**
- [Battlescape Overview](gameplay/battlescape/Battlescape%20Overview.md)
- [Turn Flow](gameplay/battlescape/Turn%20Flow.md)
- [Core Combat Math](gameplay/combat/Core%20Combat%20Math.md)

### Phoenix Point
**Destructible Environment**: Everything can be destroyed.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- Fully destructible cover and terrain
- Ballistic trajectories affected by obstacles
- Environmental tactical considerations

**References:**
- [Objects on Battle Field](gameplay/battlescape/Objects%20on%20Battle%20Field.md)

## Interception System References

### Classic X-COM (1994)
**Basic Air Combat**: Interceptor vs UFO dogfights.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- Scrambling interceptors to engage UFOs
- Craft weapons and equipment
- Success yields crash sites or landing sites
- Craft damage and repair system

**What AlienFall Completely Redesigns:**
- **Multi-environment interception**: Land, Air, Water, Underwater, Underground
- **Expanded combat scenarios**: Not just "air-to-air" combat

### AlienFall's Unique Interception System

**Classic X-COM**: Air-to-air only (interceptors chase UFOs in the sky)

**AlienFall**: **Multi-Tier Interception System**

#### 1. **Land-Based Interception**
- Ground vehicles pursue UFOs/aliens on the surface
- Tank-like craft for ground operations
- Terrestrial alien bases and ground targets

#### 2. **Air-Based Interception**
- Traditional interceptor vs UFO dogfights
- Air superiority craft
- High-speed aerial combat

#### 3. **Water Surface Interception**
- Naval vessels engage UFOs on/above water
- Ship-based interception
- Ocean mission generation

#### 4. **Underwater Interception**
- Submarines and underwater craft
- Submerged UFO/alien bases
- Pressure and depth considerations
- **Reference: X-COM: Terror from the Deep** (underwater missions)

#### 5. **Underground Interception**
- Subterranean pursuit of alien tunneling craft
- Cave systems and underground bases
- **Similar to**: Dungeon exploration but with craft/vehicle combat
- Drilling and excavation mechanics

**Why This Matters:**
- Crafts/UFOs operate **only within provinces**
- Each province can have **multiple interception layers** (surface, air, water, underground)
- A UFO might be in a province's airspace, while an alien base is in the same province's underground layer
- Creates complex strategic decisions about resource allocation

- [Interception System](gameplay/geoscape/Interception%20System.md)
- [Craft Combat](gameplay/geoscape/Craft%20Combat.md)
- [Craft Types](content/crafts/Craft%20Types.md)

### X-COM: Terror from the Deep
**Underwater Operations**: Submarines and aquatic missions.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- Underwater craft and operations
- Depth-based mechanics
- Aquatic alien species

## Map Generation References

### Procedural Roguelikes (ADOM, Brogue, DCSS)
**Block-Based Generation**: Maps assembled from prefabricated pieces.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- **Map block system** (predefined segments assembled procedurally)
- **Connectivity rules** for block assembly
- **Tileset-based visual generation**
- **Variation through rotation and mirroring**
- **Quality assurance** (playability checks)

**How It Works:**
1. **Map Blocks**: Predefined 10x10 or 20x20 segments (rooms, corridors, outdoor areas)
2. **Generator**: Assembles blocks into complete tactical maps
3. **Connectors**: Special tiles that link blocks together (doors, passages)
4. **Themes**: Urban, industrial, natural, alien base
5. **Validation**: Ensures all areas are reachable and tactically balanced

**Example:** A crash site map might combine:
- 2-3 "forest clearing" blocks
- 1 "UFO crash" special block
- 3-4 "dense woods" blocks
- Connected by "forest path" connector blocks

### Dwarf Fortress
**Complex Simulation**: Deep environmental interactions.

**What AlienFall Takes:**
- Multi-level maps with vertical gameplay
- Environmental consequences (flooding, cave-ins, fire spread)
- Emergent tactical situations

**References:**
- [Environmental Effects](gameplay/battlescape/Environmental%20Effects.md)

- [Lua Scripting](modding/Lua%20Scripting.md)

### Province-Based Geoscape with Multi-Layer Interception
**Unique System**: Combining EU4-style provinces with multi-environment combat.

**Innovation:**
- **Graph-based world** (provinces as nodes) instead of continuous space
- **Layered interception** within each province (air, land, water, underground)
- **Strategic resource allocation** across multiple combat domains
- **Simplified pathfinding** (province-to-province instead of coordinate-based)

**References:**
- [Geoscape Overview](gameplay/geoscape/Geoscape%20Overview.md)
- [Interception System](gameplay/geoscape/Interception%20System.md)

### AP + Speed Combat System

- **No mid-mission ammo anxiety**
- **Streamlined inventory** (no clips to carry)
- **Still has strategic depth** (energy recharge times, weapon power levels)

**References:**
- [Weapons](content/items/Weapons.md)
- [Equipment](content/items/Equipment.md)

### Roguelike Battlescape
**Innovation**: Procedural tactical maps with permanent consequences.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Infinite replayability** (every mission is different)
- **Emergent tactics** (players adapt to generated maps)
- **Permanent death** (soldiers lost are gone forever)
- **Environmental storytelling** (maps tell stories through layout)

## Summary

AlienFall blends mechanics from multiple game traditions:

1. **Strategic Layer**: Europa Universalis-style province map with X-COM operations
2. **Base Management**: Classic X-COM facility building (very similar to original)
3. **Tactical Combat**: Roguelike procedural generation meets squad tactics
4. **Combat Mechanics**: AP + Speed instead of TU, energy weapons instead of ammo
5. **Interception**: Multi-environment system (land, air, water, underwater, underground)
6. **Map Generation**: Block-based assembly like traditional roguelikes
7. **Lore**: X-COM Files mod conspiracy narrative
8. **Philosophy**: Open-ended sandbox with extensive moddability

This unique combination creates a fresh take on the X-COM formula while honoring its heritage.
