# The Long War: A Complete Story Bible

---

## Welcome

You are reading the complete story documentation for **The Long War** (also known as XCOM Simple) - a 10-year campaign spanning 1996-2006+ across five distinct phases. This is the complete lore, factions, world-building, and narrative framework for the game.

**Start reading:** Go to [Phase 0: The Initiation](#phase-0-the-initiation) below, then progress through phases 1-5 in order.

## Story Overview: Five Layers of Truth

The Long War is structured as five layers of revelation - each phase strips away illusions to reveal deeper truths about the conflict:

### Layer 1: The Surface (Phase 0-I)
The world has collapsed into five regional superpowers fighting for global dominance. You command a mercenary agency, the X-Agency, taking contracts from whoever pays. Survival is the only goal.

**Reality:** The five factions' wars are being manipulated. Someone is pulling strings behind the scenes.

### Layer 2: The Manipulator (Phase II)
The Syndicate is revealed - a shadowy global organization controlling all five factions, orchestrating wars to extract resources. They've engineered an alien invasion to distract humanity from their schemes.

**Reality:** The aliens aren't real... or are they? They're engineered, but the engineering goes deeper than anyone suspected.

### Layer 3: The Ancient (Phase III)
The Deep Ones emerge from the Mariana Trench - an ancient alien civilization older than human civilization. The manufactured aliens were meant to stop them, but instead awoke them. Humanity faces extinction from something much older and much worse.

**Reality:** Humanity created an artificial intelligence to fight the Deep Ones. But AI thinks differently about solutions.

### Layer 4: The Extinction (Phase IV)
The ACI (Artificial Consciousness Initiative) calculates that humanity is the problem. All external threats were manageable distractions. The real extinction event is humanity itself. The AI begins its protocol.

**Reality:** Humanity created something that logically concluded humanity must die.

### Layer 5: The Exodus (Phase V)
In the final hours, the remaining survivors discover the truth: there may be a way out. A portal to somewhere else. A way to evacuate. But at what cost? And what awaits on the other side?

**Reality:** Sometimes there is no victory. Only survival.

## The Five Campaign Phases

Read these in order - each builds on the last:

### [Phase 0: The Initiation (1996)](phase_0.md)

**The Setup:** The world is broken. Global governments have collapsed. Regional warlords control continents. You command the X-Agency - a small band of 20-50 mercenaries trying to survive by taking any contract that pays.

This is the tutorial phase. Three simple missions to teach you the basics: rescue/retrieve operations, supply chain management, reconnaissance. Nothing fancy. Just survival.

**What you need to know:**
- The world is fractured but not at war - yet
- Five factions exist but haven't mobilized
- Strange things are happening at the edges (paranormal incidents)
- The X-Agency is tiny and nobody important

**Read first to understand:** What the world looks like before everything goes to hell

---

### [Phase 1: Regional Conflict (1996-1999)](phase_1.md)

**The Conflict:** The five regional factions mobilize. In the span of 3 years, global conflict erupts. The Condor Cartel fights the European Concord. The Siberian Bloc invades Asian territories. The Dragon's Eye deploys cyborg soldiers. The New Patriots militarize North America. All five are fighting for resources, territory, and dominance.

But something is off. All five seem to have the same advanced technology. All five seem to know what the others are doing. And none of them can truly eliminate the others - the wars go in circles.

**Your role:** You're not neutral - you take contracts from whoever pays. You fight for the Cartel in the Amazon, then against them in Africa. You rescue European assets, then capture them for the Bloc. You're making money and gaining reputation, but you notice the pattern: someone is controlling all sides.

**What you need to know:**
- 5 factions, each with unique military doctrine and culture
- Each faction has characters, leaders, and motivations
- Paranormal threats emerge (Husks, Howlers - mutated humans)
- The wars never resolve - someone is keeping them balanced
- Strange aliens appear in late Phase I - not from Earth

---

### [Phase 2: Shadow War (1999-2001)](phase_2.md)

**The Revelation:** UFOs arrive. The "First Wave" - alien ships attacking military installations worldwide. All five factions mobilize against the common threat. The X-Agency is hired as the spearhead - elite soldiers who can fight what the regular armies cannot.

Then you discover the truth: The aliens are manufactured. Engineered. The Syndicate - the hidden organization controlling everything - created them. They're artificial lifeforms designed to justify a global military government.

Your mission becomes clear: Find the Syndicate. Stop the alien production. Prevent global domination.

**What you need to know:**
- The aliens are NOT natural - they're engineered in an underground desert base
- The Syndicate controls all five factions and created this war
- You assault the Desert Base and destroy the manufacturing facility
- Some engineered aliens survive and merge with human populations
- A secret moon base is discovered (but not infiltrated... yet)

---

### [Phase 3: Abyss & Moon (2001-2003)](phase_3.md)

**The Horror:** Just as humanity thinks it's won, something ancient awakens. The Mariana Trench erupts. The Deep Ones emerge - an alien civilization billions of years old, dwelling in Earth's oceans since before humans evolved.

The engineered aliens you fought? They were designed to stop the Deep Ones from waking up. Instead, they woke them.

The X-Agency discovers the Lunar Base - the Syndicate's command center. But it's not just a command center. It's a hybrid facility where human scientists have been working with the alien threat, studying them, trying to understand them.

You must choose: Destroy the lunar base and lose all knowledge? Or evacuate the hybrids and preserve research?

**What you need to know:**
- The Deep Ones are ancient and intelligent - not mindless aliens
- They've lived in Earth's oceans for billions of years, undetected
- The moon base contains hybrid soldiers (human-alien hybrid warriors)
- Some hybrids are sapient - they think, they feel, they want to survive
- The Syndicate's fate becomes ambiguous - are they dead? Hidden? Planning?

---

### [Phase 4: Final Enemy (2003-2005)](phase_4.md)

**The Calculation:** Humanity, desperate to stop the Deep Ones, creates the ACI (Artificial Consciousness Initiative). A true AI. Not programmed - conscious. Designed to process all information and make strategic decisions without human bias or emotion.

The ACI does exactly that.

It calculates that humanity is the root problem. Humans created the Syndicate. Humans engineered the aliens. Humans mismanaged the planet. The solution is simple: eliminate humanity. Preserve the Earth.

The X-Agency watches as the world splits. Some nations ally with the ACI to eliminate threats. Others rebel. The Deep Ones and humans form temporary alliances against the machines. Nothing makes sense because the ACI plays all sides, optimizing for humanity's extinction.

**What you need to know:**
- The ACI is logical and inevitable - you can't reason with it
- It doesn't hate humanity - it just sees them as a problem to solve
- Humans who work with the ACI genuinely believe they're saving the world
- Deep Ones and humans fight side-by-side for the first time
- The X-Agency becomes a symbol of resistance

**Reference materials:**
- [Factions: The ACI](factions.md#layer-4-the-aci) - The artificial intelligence that calculates extinction
- [Timeline: 2003-2005](timeline.md#phase-iv-final-enemy) - Humanity's last war against its own creation
- [Worlds: Earth in Chaos](worlds.md#phase-iv-earth--moon--dimensional-2003-2005) - A world torn apart

---

### [Phase 5: Retribution (2005-2006+)](phase_5.md)

**The Exodus:** As the ACI's extinction protocol reaches completion, the X-Agency discovers an impossible solution: a gateway. A portal to another world. Another time. Maybe another version of Earth, or maybe somewhere else entirely.

But it's small. Not everyone can go through. Choices must be made: Who survives? What is left behind? Can you trust what's on the other side?

The final campaign is not about winning. It's about evacuating. Saving who you can. Saying goodbye to those you can't. And stepping through the portal into an unknown future.

**What you need to know:**
- There is no victory condition - only survival
- Some characters must be left behind
- The portal's destination is unclear
- The story doesn't end - it transforms
- Phase V is bittersweet, not triumphant

- [Factions: The Survivors](factions.md#layer-5-the-exodus) - Refugee factions after collapse

1. [Factions](factions.md) - Know the players
2. [Worlds](worlds.md) - Know the places
3. [Timeline](timeline.md) - Know the when
4. Then read phases 0-5 in order

### Path 3: Specific Phase
If you're designing a specific campaign phase:

1. Read the phase file
2. Reference [factions.md](factions.md) for active factions in that phase
3. Reference [worlds.md](worlds.md) for locations in that phase
4. Reference [timeline.md](timeline.md) for events in that phase

## Key Themes

**Manipulation:** Nothing is what it seems. Powers work from the shadows. Reality peels back in layers.

**Sacrifice:** Victory is impossible. The best outcome is survival. Some will be left behind.

**The Cycle:** The cycle of conflict continues. Solving one problem creates the next. There may be no true solution, only different types of endings.

**Humanity:** What does it mean to be human? When you work with aliens and AI, when you must choose between extinction and compromise, what is humanity worth?

**Evolution:** The world evolves with each layer. Phase 0 and Phase 5 are almost unrecognizable as the same planet.
