- **Thematic coherence** (why things matter, not just what happens)

## The Story It Tells

The Long War is fundamentally a story about:
1. **Hubris** - Powers believe they control events; they don't
2. **Unintended Consequences** - Every solution creates bigger problems
3. **Layers of Deception** - Multiple hidden truths beneath apparent reality
4. **Adaptation vs. Rigidity** - Flexibility succeeds where planning fails
5. **The Cost of Victory** - Winning everything means losing everything
6. **Survival Over Ideology** - When everything is threatened, beliefs matter less than adaptation
7. **The Unpredictability of Universe** - No system can perfectly control reality
