## PHASE 0-I: EARTH (1996-1999)

### Overview
The world has fractured into five regional superpowers, each controlling continents and conducting low-level warfare for resources. Humanity survives in a state of perpetual conflict where factions struggle for global dominance.

### The Five Factions' Territories

#### 1. CONDOR CARTEL (South America, Africa partial)
**Geographic Base:** Amazon Basin, Brazilian highlands, Central American regions  
**Area of Control:** ~40% of South America, ~30% of Central Africa (West Africa)  
**Key Cities:** S√£o Paulo, Bogot√°, Lagos, Kinshasa  
**Population:** ~200 million (heavily militarized)

**Biomes Present:**
- **Amazon Jungle (Dense Forest)** - Primary stronghold; 5,000+ km of dense vegetation
  - Visibility: Low (10-15 meters)
  - Cover: Abundant (trees, undergrowth, river systems)
  - Threats: Jungle warfare specialists, hidden bases, river navigation required
  - Resources: Rare earth minerals, medicinal plants, renewable resources

- **Tropical Savanna** - Buffer zone between jungle and urban centers
  - Visibility: Moderate (30-50 meters)
  - Cover: Scattered trees, grass fields

  - Port cities: Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife
  - Maritime operations: Piracy, naval warfare, blockade tactics
  - Depth: Shallow continental shelf transitions to deep ocean near African coast

**Syndicate Manipulation:** Controlled through artificial scarcity of rare-earth minerals, which are essential for advanced manufacturing. The Syndicate deliberately restricts supply, forcing global competition and driving Condor Cartel into expansionist wars.

**Notable Feature:** Tox-Weavers infestation in Amazon (mutated venomous spiders from Condor's toxic dumping); creates secondary threat independent of faction warfare.

#### 2. EUROPEAN CONCORD (Europe, partial Africa)
**Geographic Base:** Europe from Portugal to Eastern Europe, North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia)  
**Area of Control:** ~35% of Europe, ~15% of North Africa  
**Key Cities:** Brussels (HQ), Berlin, Paris, Moscow outskirts, Cairo  
**Population:** ~250 million (highly urbanized)

**Biomes Present:**
- **Urban/Industrial Centers** - Core strongholds; dense city environments

## PHASE III: EARTH + MOON + MARIANA TRENCH (2001-2003)

### Overview
The Syndicate's plan fails; X-Agency defeats manufactured aliens. In desperation, Syndicate reactivates the Abyss Project. Deep Ones awaken and begin expanding from oceanic depths. Simultaneously, Syndicate reveals Lunar Base and flees to it. X-Agency must pursue to Moon while also fighting genuine threat (Deep Ones) in oceans and coastal zones.

### New Locations in Phase III

#### 1. THE MARIANA TRENCH DEEP ONE CIVILIZATION (Pacific Ocean)
**Location:** Mariana Trench and surrounding Pacific abyssal zone  
**Geographic Coordinates:** Off the coast of Guam/Philippines region  
**Strategic Depth:** 8,000-11,000+ meters below sea level  
**Mapped Territory:** ~50 km radius; true extent unknown (Deep Ones have expanded extensively)

**Overview:**
The Mariana Trench is the deepest oceanic location on Earth and serves as the primary Deep One civilization center. This is not merely a single military base‚Äîit is a multi-species society built across impossible depths, utilizing both the abandoned Abyss Project facility and extensive natural cavern systems carved by the Deep Ones themselves over decades of habitation.

**The Debris Field: Satellite Junkyard (Strategic Resource)**

**What Humans Dumped:**
By 2001, the Mariana Trench had become an unofficial graveyard for:
- **Military satellites** (~40% of satellites launched were material transport disguised as communications/weather infrastructure)
- **End-of-life spacecraft components**
- **Rocket stages** (first stages typically crash into ocean)
- **Industrial waste** from Syndicate front companies
- **Decommissioned military equipment**
- **Total estimated mass:** Several million tons of metal, rare-earth elements, machinery

**What Deep Ones Found:**
When Deep Ones expanded into the trench (beginning ~2000, accelerating ~2001-2003), they discovered an enormous resource treasure:
- Raw metals (iron, copper, aluminum, titanium)
- Rare-earth elements essential for technology
- Advanced electronics (computers, circuit boards, solar panels)
- Structural materials (steel frames, composite polymers)
- Energy systems (nuclear fuel cells, power generators)

**Strategic Significance:**
The debris field transformed the Deep Ones from purely biological civilization into a technological hybrid. They began:
- Repurposing satellite technology for their own uses
- Extracting and smelting metals for construction
- Learning human technology through reverse-engineering
- Creating hybrid bio-mechanical systems
- Establishing manufacturing capacity

**The Irony:** The Syndicate inadvertently created the infrastructure for the Deep Ones to challenge human technological superiority.

**Facility Layers and Architecture:**

**Upper Abyssal Zone (6,000-8,000m):** Border Territory
- Transition zone; mixture of natural caves and Deep One expansion
- **Features:**
  - Pressure: 600-800 atmospheres
  - Temperature: 4-6¬∞C
  - Bioluminescence: Common (enables visibility of 10-20 meters)
  - Flora: Deep-sea creatures, chemosynthetic bacteria colonies, bioluminescent organisms
  - Threats: Hydrotermal vents (sudden heat; toxic chemicals), unstable cave structures
- **Purpose:** Early warning system; Deep One scouts and patrols
- **Resources:** Hydrothermal vent minerals; unique food sources

**Middle Abyss (8,000-10,000m):** Primary Abyss Project Facility and Main Hive
- **Upper Level (8,000-9,000m): Bio-Engineering and Experimental Zones**
  - Original Syndicate genetic modification chambers
  - Mutation tanks (now organic, grown rather than built)
  - Evolution testing grounds (accelerated evolution chambers)
  - Subject containment areas (mostly empty; creatures released or evolved beyond confinement)
  - **Hazard:** Unstable mutations; residual bioweapon hazards; aggressive indigenous creatures

- **Middle Level (9,000-10,000m): Primary Hive Structure and Deep One Civilization Center**
  - Breeding grounds for Deep One expansion
  - Hive coordination chambers (neural nexus points where psionic networks converge)
  - The Primary Entity's location(s) (distributed consciousness spanning multiple forms; constantly moving)
  - Distributed consciousness nexus (location where multiple Deep One minds merge into unified thought)
  - Administrative/Council chambers (where Deep One civilization's decisions are made)
  - Food/agricultural areas (farming chemosynthetic bacteria, cultivating pressure-adapted biomatter)
  - **Cultural Note:** Deep Ones have developed art, music (psionic/vibrational), and philosophy; this is not merely a hive of drones but an actual civilization
  - **Population:** Estimated 10,000-50,000 Deep Ones in core settlement

- **Lower Level (10,000-11,000m+): Ancient Facility and Unknown Origins**
  - Original Abyss Project construction (1950s-1970s origin)
  - Sealed chambers (purpose unknown; possibly contains original genetic material source)
  - Organic overgrowth (40+ years of uncontrolled evolution has transformed metal into bio-mechanical structures)
  - **Unknown/Theoretical:** Ancient alien technology core (source of the original genetic templates used to create Deep Ones; possibly active or semi-sentient)
  - Absolute pressure extreme (1,000+ atmospheres); unsuitable for human exploration without extreme preparation

**Deep One Sub-Species Distribution:**

1. **The Hydrae** - Occupy mid-levels; serve as scientists and researchers
2. **The Stalkers** - Patrol upper levels; hunting and defense
3. **The Chorus** - Located in specific nexus points; maintain psionic networks
4. **The Leviathans** - Guard deep levels; act as living fortresses and weapons
5. **The Hybrids** - Scattered throughout; serve as potential bridges to human civilization

**Environmental Hazards:**

1. **Pressure Gradient:** Humans ascending/descending can suffer decompression sickness; takes 12-24 hours to transition between pressure zones safely
2. **Temperature Shifts:** Hydrothermal vents can cause sudden temperature swings; equipment malfunction
3. **Corrosion:** Deep-sea acidic environment; equipment degradation accelerates
4. **Biohazards:** Deep One diseases/toxins don't affect humans but environmental hazards from bioaccumulation exist
5. **Structural Instability:** Decades of organic overgrowth means walls, floors could collapse
6. **Psionic Interference:** Strong psionic emanations cause hallucinations and disorientation in humans (especially those with latent psionic sensitivity)
7. **Navigation Difficulty:** Cavern systems are labyrinthine; easy to become lost; beacons malfunction due to interference

**The Satellite Scrap Operations:**
- Deep Ones maintain "mining operations" in the debris field
- Specialized Stalker teams extract valuable materials
- Smelting chambers where metals are extracted and refined
- Assembly zones where salvaged technology is adapted and repurposed
- Transportation tunnels connecting debris field to main settlement

**Mission Accessibility:**
- Requires deep-sea equipment and specialized training
- Must deal with extreme environmental hazards
- Can be partially explored through infiltration or negotiation
- Complete Deep One civilization is never fully explored; always maintains mystery
- The Primary Entity remains elusive; can be communicated with but not physically defeated

#### 1b. THE LUNAR BASE EXPANDED (Earth's Moon)
**Location:** Lunar surface; exact coordinates classified (hidden from public view; far side of Moon)  
**Area:** ~100 km¬≤ of mapped territory; ~50 km¬≤ underground facilities  
**Biome:** Airless environment; extreme temperature/radiation

**Facility Expansion: Portal Technology and Manufacturing**

**The Satellite Transport System (1970-2000):**

The Syndicate developed an ingenious transport system for moving materials from Earth to Moon without visible rockets:

1. **Modified Satellite Infrastructure:**
   - 40% of all satellites launched as "communications," "GPS," "weather," or "internet infrastructure" were actually material transport vessels
   - These satellites contained cargo pods that could be remotely controlled
   - Final stage trajectories were designed to pass through pre-planned rendezvous points in Earth orbit

2. **Orbital Relay Stations:**
   - Hidden stations in high Earth orbit (difficult for civilian observation)
   - Retrieved cargo from modified satellites
   - Transferred materials to Lunar shuttles
   - Destroyed or de-orbited evidence of the transfer operations

3. **Lunar Transport Shuttles:**
   - Purpose-built spacecraft designed for stealth (low radar signature, minimal emissions)
   - Used dimensional teleportation portals (pre-2003) for final transfer to Moon
   - Before portal completion, used conventional spacecraft landing zones

4. **Material Flow Statistics:**
   - Estimated 500,000+ tons of material transported to Lunar Base over 30 years

  - Originally designed for spatial teleportation only (Earth orbit ‚Üî Lunar orbit)
  - During emergency activation (Phase III), temporal component activated unexpectedly
  - Created simultaneous spatial-temporal displacement
  - Syndicate leadership attempted escape through portal to unknown destination
  - Portal ceased functioning after the leadership's passage

- **Residual Portal Radiation:**
  - Portal failure left dimensional "scar" at the facility
  - Radiation detectable by sophisticated equipment
  - Causes minor temporal distortions in nearby area
  - Could theoretically allow Third Wave aliens to detect the portal's former location and trace through to past Earth

**Crater Cover and Camouflage:**
- Lunar Base entrance disguised as natural asteroid impact crater
- Radar-reflecting materials mimicking moon dust composition
- From Earth observation, appears as unremarkable crater among thousands
- Satellite imagery (public and most classified) shows nothing unusual
- Only detailed analysis of multiple observations would reveal artificial nature

**Personnel and Operations:**
- Estimated 500-1,000 Syndicate operatives stationed continuously
- Support staff, scientists, military commanders
- Rotating 3-5 year assignments to maximize recruitment secrecy
- Some personnel didn't realize true nature of their work (compartmentalized knowledge)

**Strategic Significance (Phase III Context):**
