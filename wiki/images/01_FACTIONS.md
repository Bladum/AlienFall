## Usage Notes for AI Image Generation

### For Gemini Image Generator:
- Provide full prompt text
- Request "pixel art style" explicitly
- Specify "isometric perspective" for consistency
- Request specific color hex codes
- Ask for "no anti-aliasing" or "hard pixel edges"

### For GPT-5 Image Generator (when available):
- Use same prompts
- May support animated or dynamic variations
- Can request "glowing effects" more directly
- Better handling of complex scenes

### Generation Tips:
1. **Color Consistency:** Use hex codes to ensure faction color palettes remain consistent
2. **Scale:** Request "32x32 base tile" scale for UI integration
3. **Style:** Always specify "pixel art" and "hard edges" (not soft/smooth)
4. **Details:** More detailed prompts = more consistent results
5. **Batch Generation:** Generate 2-3 variations per prompt, select best
