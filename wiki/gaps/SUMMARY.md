# Gap Analysis Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Scope:** API vs Systems Documentation Comparison  
**Purpose:** Identify inconsistencies, invented mechanics, and missing information

---

## Overview

This gap analysis compares API documentation (`wiki/api/`) against Systems documentation (`wiki/systems/`) to ensure API does not invent mechanics and stays grounded in authoritative system design specifications.

## Common Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: API Invents Numeric Values
**Examples:**
- AI confidence starts at 60%, -5% per casualty, +3% per hit
- Threat score = (ThreatLevel √ó 0.5) + (Distance √ó 0.3) + (Visibility √ó 0.2)
- Squad size multipliers: 0.75 (easy), 1.0 (normal), 1.25 (hard), 1.5 (impossible)

**Recommendation:** Systems must specify all numeric ranges and formulas used in gameplay calculations.

### Pattern 2: API Documents Full Systems, Systems Provides Minimal Info
**Examples:**
- Assets: API has full inventory/procurement system, Systems only has file formats
- Some systems: API provides complete implementation, Systems has only conceptual overview

**Recommendation:** Either add systems to Systems documentation, or mark API sections as "planned/example"

### Pattern 3: Excellent Alignment on Core Mechanics
**Examples:**
- Analytics: Full pipeline, data flow, metric definitions all aligned
- Basescape: Facility types, adjacency bonuses, power system all consistent

**Observation:** When both documents are comprehensive, alignment is excellent. Problems occur when Systems is sparse.

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Action Point Range (AI Systems)
**User mentioned:** Action points range 1-4  
**API documentation:** Shows action_points_bonus but no base range  
**Systems documentation:** No mention of action points at all

**Required Fix:**
- Systems MUST document: "Units have 1-4 action points base (difficulty may modify)"
- API should reference Systems specification

### 2. Inventory & Procurement (Assets)
**API documentation:** Full inventory, storage, procurement, maintenance systems  
**Systems documentation:** Only file formats and mod structure

**Required Fix:**
- Determine if these systems exist in game
- If YES: Add comprehensive inventory/procurement documentation to Systems
- If NO: Mark API sections as "planned feature" or "example implementation"

### 3. Confidence System (AI Systems)
**API documentation:** Confidence 0-100, starts at 60%, specific modifiers  
**Systems documentation:** No mention of confidence system

**Required Fix:**
- If confidence system exists: Add to Systems with exact values
- If not: Remove specific values from API, mark as configurable

---

## Best Practices Identified

### From Analytics Documentation (Exemplary):
1. ‚úÖ Systems provides comprehensive strategic vision
2. ‚úÖ API provides implementation details and function signatures
3. ‚úÖ Both documents use same terminology and concepts
4. ‚úÖ No invented mechanics - all grounded in design
5. ‚úÖ Examples are clearly marked as examples

### From Basescape Documentation (Excellent):
1. ‚úÖ Numeric values consistent between documents
2. ‚úÖ Systems provides design rationale, API provides implementation
3. ‚úÖ Both documents comprehensive and detailed
4. ‚úÖ Very few conflicts or gaps

---

## Recommendations for Remaining Analyses

### High Priority Files:
1. **BATTLESCAPE** - Combat is core mechanic, critical to align
2. **UNITS** - Stats, ranges, action points must be authoritative
3. **ITEMS/WEAPONS** - Damage ranges, accuracy, all values must match

### Medium Priority Files:
4. **ECONOMY** - Financial systems, costs, must be consistent
5. **GEOSCAPE** - Strategic layer mechanics
6. **INTERCEPTION** - Combat resolution

### Lower Priority Files:
7. **GUI** - Implementation detail, less critical for gameplay
8. **POLITICS/LORE** - Narrative content, less prone to conflicts

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete remaining gap analyses** (Battlescape through Units)
2. **Prioritize fixes** based on gameplay impact
3. **Update Systems documentation** with missing critical information
4. **Verify API accuracy** against actual game implementation
5. **Establish process** to prevent future divergence
