---

## Critical Gaps

**NONE FOUND** - Both documents are highly consistent in describing the analytics pipeline, simulation architecture, and data flow.

---

## Moderate Gaps

### 1. Performance Monitor Entity - NOT IN SYSTEMS

**Location:** API - Core Entities section

**API Claims:**
```lua
perf_monitor = PerformanceMonitor.create()
perf_monitor:record_frame(fps, memory_usage, draw_calls)
perf_monitor:get_average_fps(time_window)
```

**Systems Documentation:**
- ❌ **NO MENTION** of PerformanceMonitor as a specific entity
- ✅ Performance profiling described conceptually
- ❌ **NO API** for performance monitoring objects

**Impact:** MODERATE - API provides implementation API not described in Systems  
**Recommendation:** Systems should list PerformanceMonitor as an entity with methods

---

### 2. Report Builder Entity - NOT IN SYSTEMS

**Location:** API - Core Entities section

**API Claims:**
```lua
builder = ReportBuilder.create(title)
builder:add_section(section_name, content)
builder:add_chart(chart_type, data, title)
```
