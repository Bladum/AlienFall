## Executive Summary

The Interception documentation shows **MODERATE ALIGNMENT** with **3 critical gaps** identified. The API provides extensive mechanical details while Systems establishes the conceptual framework, but several core combat mechanics need Systems authority.

**Key Strengths:**
- Three-sector system (Air/Land/Underground) perfectly aligned
- Turn-based card-game analogy consistent
- Action Point (AP) and Energy Point (EP) systems match
- Weapon type interactions well-defined
- Object deactivation mechanics aligned

**Critical Gaps:**
- Hit chance calculation formulas invented by API
- Damage calculation specifics missing from Systems
- Thermal mechanics in Systems but not verified in API

**Overall Rating:** B (Good structure, needs core formula documentation)

---

  
**Location:** API documents calculation, Systems silent  
**Issue:** Core combat mechanic formula invented by API without Systems authority

**API Claims:**
```lua
InterceptionCombat.calculateHitChance(unit, weapon, target) → number
```
Also: `accuracy_base = number, -- Base hit chance (0.5-0.95)`

**Systems Says:**
Only mentions weapon property "Chance to Hit: Accuracy rating" with no formula or specific values.

**Problem:** How is hit chance calculated? API shows 50-95% base accuracy but Systems never specifies. Is it:
- Weapon base accuracy only?
- Modified by distance?
- Affected by unit stats?
- Evasion subtracted?

Without Systems specification, API invents critical combat outcome mechanic.

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
### Systems Interception.md - Add to Weapon Mechanics:

**Hit Chance Calculation:**
Base Hit Chance = Weapon Accuracy - (Distance Penalty) - (Target Evasion Bonus)

Where:
- Weapon Accuracy: 50% (low) to 95% (high) depending on weapon type
- Distance Penalty: -(Range - Optimal Range) × 2% per hex beyond optimal
- Target Evasion Bonus: Target's evasion stat (0-30%)

Example: Missile (80% accuracy) at 10 hex range (optimal 8) vs evasive craft (20% evasion)
= 80% - (2×2%) - 20% = 56% hit chance
```

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Determines combat outcomes and tactical viability of weapons.

---

### 2. Damage Calculation Formula Missing
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** API shows damage processing, Systems only mentions damage values  
**Issue:** How damage translates to HP loss not documented

**API Claims:**
```lua
InterceptionCombat.calculateDamage(weapon, is_critical) → number
```
Also shows: `damage_base`, `damage_min`, `damage_max`, `damage_variance`

**Systems Says:**
"Damage Value: Raw damage on successful hit (no armor/resistance calculations)"
"No Armor Reduction Multipliers: Damage applies equally regardless of armor"

**Problem:** Systems says "no armor" but then what IS the formula? API shows:
- Base damage
- Min/max ranges
- Variance percentages
- Critical bonus

How do these combine? Systems needs to specify.

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
### Systems Interception.md - Add to Combat Model:

**Damage Calculation:**
Final Damage = Base Damage × (1 + Random(-Variance, +Variance))
Where:
- Base Damage: Weapon's damage rating
- Variance: ±10% typical (weapons vary)
- No armor mitigation (intentional design choice)
- No critical hit multipliers (damage is consistent)

Example: Missile with 80 damage, 10% variance
= 80 × (1 + Random(-0.10, +0.10))
= 72-88 damage per hit
```

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Core combat outcome calculation undefined.

---

### 3. Altitude Sector Capacity Limit (4 Objects) Not Documented
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** Systems mentions sectors but not capacity, API silent on this  
**Issue:** Neither document specifies maximum objects per sector

**API:** Shows InterceptionUnit array but no capacity limit  
**Systems:** "Maximum 4 objects per sector"

**Problem:** Wait - Systems DOES say "Maximum 4 objects per sector" in Strategic Environment section! Let me re-check...

Actually checking Systems: YES, it's there: "Maximum 4 objects per sector"

**CORRECTION:** This is actually documented in Systems. This is NOT a gap. Systems specifies capacity correctly.

**Action:** Remove this from critical gaps. No issue here.

---

## Moderate Gaps (Should Fix)

### 3. Weapon Cooldown Turn Count Undefined
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems mentions cooldown but doesn't specify turn counts by weapon type

**API:**
```
cooldown = number, -- Turns between successive shots (e.g., missiles fire every 3 turns)
```

**Systems:**
"Cooldown: Turns between successive shots (e.g., missiles fire every 3 turns)"

**Problem:** Systems gives one example (missiles = 3 turns) but no systematic documentation of cooldown values per weapon class.

**Recommendation:** Systems should document:
```markdown
**Weapon Cooldown Values:**
- Point Defense: 1 turn (rapid fire)
- Main Cannon: 1 turn (sustained)
- Missile Pod: 2 turns (reload time)
- Laser Array: 0 turns (sustained beam, EP limited)
- Plasma Caster: 2 turns (energy recharge)
```

---

### 4. Range Turn Delay Values Per Weapon Type
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems shows range table but API adds min/max/optimal range properties

**Systems Table:**
| Range Class | Turns to Impact |
| Close | 5 turns |
| Short | 4 turns |
| Medium | 3 turns |
| Long | 2 turns |
| Very Long | 1 turn |

**API Properties:**
```lua
range_min = number,
range_max = number,
range_optimal = number,
```

**Problem:** API adds range boundaries (min/max/optimal) not in Systems table. Are these separate concepts?

**Recommendation:** Clarify: "Range classes define projectile flight time. Each weapon has min/max effective range (20-60km typical) within which flight time applies."

---

### 5. Evasion Percentage Range Undefined
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** API shows evasion as 0-100% but Systems doesn't specify range

**API:** `evasion = number, -- Dodge chance (0-100%)`  
**Systems:** "Evasion Maneuver" action exists but no percentage range

**Problem:** What are typical evasion values? 10%? 50%? Systems should establish range.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Evasion Range: 0-30% typical, 50% for specialized craft, affects hit chance reduction".

---

### 6. Energy Regeneration Rates Per Unit Type
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems provides examples but API formula unclear

**Systems:**
- Bases: 50+ EP/turn typical
- Large Craft: 10-15 EP/turn
- Small Craft: 5-10 EP/turn

**API:** Shows energy pool but no regeneration calculation

**Problem:** Are these exact values or examples? Should be authoritative in Systems.

**Recommendation:** Systems should strengthen: "Energy Regeneration Rates (per turn): Bases 50-60 EP, Large Craft 10-15 EP, Small Craft 5-10 EP".

---

### 7. Thermal Mechanics Details Vague
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems mentions heat but doesn't provide jamming mechanics

**Systems:**
"Heat accumulation: +5 per weapon shot, -10 per turn cooling (bases -15)
Jam threshold: Weapon jams at 100+ heat"

**API:** No thermal system documented

**Problem:** If thermal mechanics exist (Systems documents them), API should implement. If not, Systems shouldn't invent.

**Recommendation:** Verify thermal system exists. If yes, API should document. If no, remove from Systems.

---

### 8. Deactivation Probability Formulas
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems gives probability ranges but not formula

**Systems:**
- >50% Health: No deactivation risk
- 25-50% Health: 10-20% per turn
- <25% Health: 40-60% per turn

**API:** No deactivation probability calculation

**Problem:** Exact formula? Linear interpolation? Random within range?

**Recommendation:** Clarify: "Deactivation Chance = (100 - HP%) × Damage Factor, where Factor = 0.2 for 25-50%, 0.5 for <25%".

---

### 9. Base Defense Experience Gain Clarification
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems says "Base Defenders: Do NOT gain experience" but is this absolute?

**Systems:** "Base defenders: Do NOT gain experience from base defense actions"  
**API:** No mention

**Problem:** Absolute rule or just reduced? Clarification needed.

**Recommendation:** Strengthen: "Base defenders gain 0 experience (bases are static installations, not crew-operated)".

---

### 10. Round/Turn Terminology Inconsistency
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** API uses "rounds" and "turns" interchangeably, Systems uses "turns"

**API:** `current_round = number`, `max_rounds = number`  
**Systems:** Consistently uses "turns"

**Problem:** Are "rounds" and "turns" the same? Terminology should be unified.

**Recommendation:** Standardize on "turn" throughout. Update API to use `current_turn`, `max_turns`.

---

## Minor Gaps (Nice to Fix)

### 11. Interception Battle Max Duration (20 Turns)
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows 20/30 turns in different places

**API InterceptionBattle:** `max_rounds = number, -- 20 = typical engagement length`  
**API Interception:** `max_turns = number, -- 30 typical`

**Problem:** Conflicting maximums. Which is correct?

**Recommendation:** Systems should establish: "Maximum Engagement Duration: 30 turns (draw if no victor)".

---

### 12. Altitude Layer Names
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Minor terminology: API uses "air/land/underwater", Systems uses "Air/Land or Water/Underground"

**API:** `altitude_layer = string, -- "air", "land", "underwater"`  
**Systems:** "Air Sector, Land/Water Sector, Underground Sector"

**Problem:** "land" vs "land/water" - should middle layer include water?

**Recommendation:** Standardize: Use "air", "surface", "underground" to clarify middle layer includes land AND water.

---

### 13. Weapon Type Properties Comprehensive List
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems lists weapon properties but API adds more

**Systems:** Chance to Hit, AP Cost, EP Cost, Cooldown, Range, Damage  
**API Adds:** Tracking type, speed, damage_type, critical_chance, effect

**Problem:** API extends Systems properties list. Are these all needed?

**Recommendation:** Systems should document complete property list for consistency.

---

### 14. Status Effect Durations
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems mentions effects (stun, disable) but not duration

**Systems:** Lists stun, disable, puncture, EMP, incendiary  
**API:** `status_effects = string[]` but no duration tracking

**Problem:** How long do effects last? 1 turn? Permanent?

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Status Effect Duration: Stun 1 turn, Disable 2 turns, Puncture ongoing, EMP 1 turn, Incendiary 3 turns".

---

### 15. Armor Value Range for Interception Units
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows armor (0-50) but Systems doesn't specify range

**API:** `armor = number, -- Damage reduction (0-50)`  
**Systems:** Mentions armor but no numeric range

**Problem:** Is 0-50 accurate? Should Systems document?

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Armor Rating Range: 0 (unarmored) to 50 (heavy fortification)".

---

### 16. Weapon Ammo Capacity Examples
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows ammo properties but no typical values

**API:** `ammo_capacity = number`, `ammo_per_shot = number`  
**Systems:** No ammo examples

**Problem:** What are typical capacities? 10 missiles? 100 bullets?

**Recommendation:** Systems can add examples: "Typical Ammo: Missiles 4-8, Cannons 50-100, Energy weapons unlimited".

---

### 17. Victory/Defeat Reward Calculations
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Neither document specifies reward formulas

**API:** `victory_rewards = table, -- XP, loot, research`  
**Systems:** No reward calculation

**Problem:** How much XP? What loot? Formula needed.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Victory Rewards: XP = Enemy Threat × 50, Credits = Enemy Value × 10, Research = Enemy Tech Level".

---

### 18. Special Effects Chance Percentages
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows `effect_chance = number` but Systems doesn't give typical values

**API:** Weapon can have effect trigger percentage  
**Systems:** Lists effects but not probabilities

**Problem:** Is stun 10% chance? 50%? Systems should guide.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Effect Trigger Chance: Stun 25%, Disable 15%, Puncture 30%, EMP 20%, Incendiary 40%".

---

### 19. Interception Location Hex Coordinate
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows `location = HexCoordinate` but Systems doesn't mention position tracking

**API:** Interception happens at specific geoscape location  
**Systems:** No mention of location tracking

**Problem:** Does location affect anything? Biome effects?

**Recommendation:** Clarify: "Interception Location: Tracked for biome effects and reinforcement distance calculations".

---

5. **Define Evasion Range** - Add 0-30% typical evasion range to Systems
6. **Standardize Turn Terminology** - Replace "rounds" with "turns" throughout
7. **Clarify Range Properties** - Explain min/max/optimal range vs range classes

### Long-Term Enhancements (Medium Priority)

8. **Add Energy Regen Rates** - Make regeneration values authoritative in Systems
9. **Document Status Effect Durations** - Specify how long each effect lasts
10. **Define Reward Calculations** - Add victory reward formulas to Systems

---

## Conclusion

Interception documentation shows **acceptable alignment** with **3 critical gaps** requiring immediate attention. The hit chance and damage formulas MUST be documented in Systems to prevent API from inventing core combat mechanics. The thermal system needs verification (appears in Systems but not API). Systems establishes excellent conceptual framework (3-sector system, AP/EP economy, card-game analogy) but needs to add mechanical formulas for implementation consistency. Overall grade reflects good structure needing targeted formula additions.

**Overall Grade:** B (Good structure, needs core formula documentation)
