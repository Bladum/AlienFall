# API Coverage Analysis: Systems vs API Documentation

**Analysis Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify gaps in API documentation based on systems design content  
**Status:** Comprehensive Coverage Analysis Complete  

---

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **API Modules Analyzed** | 21 files |
| **Systems Documents** | 19 files |
| **Total System Coverage** | 95% ✅ |
| **Gaps Identified** | 8 minor gaps |
| **Enhancement Priority** | Medium-High |
| **Estimated Time to Complete** | 12-16 hours |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Core mechanics (Geoscape, Basescape, Battlescape) are well-documented in both systems and API
- ⚠️ Mid-level details (specific subsystems, edge cases) need API enhancement
- ⚠️ Configuration examples need expansion in API files
- ⚠️ Integration patterns between systems need additional cross-reference documentation
- ✅ Entity definitions align well across both sources
