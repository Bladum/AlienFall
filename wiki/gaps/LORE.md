## Moderate Gaps (Should Fix)

### 1. Campaign Escalation Formula Specifics
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems provides escalation description but not precise formula

**Systems Says:**
```
Base campaigns per month: 2 (Quarter 1)
Escalation rate: +1 new campaign per quarter
Maximum campaigns capped at 10 per month
```

**API Shows:**
No specific escalation calculation formula

**Problem:** How exactly does escalation work? Is it:
- Linear: Q1=2, Q2=3, Q3=4, Q4=5?
- Compound: Multiple factions each add campaigns?
- Player-level dependent?

Systems gives concept but formula needs precision.

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
### Systems Lore.md - Add to Campaign Escalation Formula:

**Precise Escalation Calculation:**
Campaigns Per Month = MIN(Base + (Current_Quarter - 1), Max_Cap)

Where:
- Base = 2 campaigns/month
- Current_Quarter = 1-4 (then 5, 6, 7... for ongoing campaign)
- Max_Cap = 10 campaigns/month

Example:
- Q1 (Month 1-3): 2 campaigns/month
- Q2 (Month 4-6): 3 campaigns/month
- Q3 (Month 7-9): 4 campaigns/month
- Q4 (Month 10-12): 5 campaigns/month
- Year 2+: Continues +1 per quarter until hitting cap of 10
```

---

### 2. Milestone Completion Condition Specifics
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** API shows milestone triggers but Systems doesn't define completion formulas

**API:**
```lua
Milestone = {
  trigger_conditions = table,
  completion_conditions = table,
}
```

**Systems:**
Discusses milestones but doesn't specify what completion conditions look like.

**Problem:** What are valid completion conditions? Examples:
- "Destroy 5 UFOs"
- "Achieve +50 relations with country"
- "Research technology X"

Systems should provide examples.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems:
```markdown
**Milestone Completion Condition Types:**
- Mission Count: "Complete N missions of type X"
- Research Gates: "Complete research project Y"
- Relationship Threshold: "Achieve +R relations with country Z"
- Territory Control: "Control N provinces in region"
- Enemy Elimination: "Destroy N enemy units/bases"
- Time Survival: "Survive T turns without base loss"
```

---

### 3. Faction Budget Allocation Mechanics
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems mentions "autonomous_budget" but doesn't explain how factions earn/spend credits

**Systems Shows:**
```
autonomous_budget = number, -- Faction credits
```

**API Shows:**
```lua
FactionLore = {
  autonomous_budget = number,
}
```

**Problem:** How do factions get budget?
- Monthly allocation?
- Mission rewards?
- Territory income?

And how do they spend it?
- Unit recruitment?
- Research?
- Base construction?

Systems should clarify.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems:
```markdown
**Faction Budget System:**

**Income Sources:**
- Base Income: 10,000 credits/month per active faction
- Mission Success: +2,000 credits per completed campaign
- Territory Control: +500 credits per controlled province
- Black Market: +1,000 credits per successful covert operation

**Expenditures:**
- Unit Recruitment: 1,000-5,000 credits per unit
- Research Projects: 5,000-20,000 credits per tech
- Base Construction: 50,000+ credits per new base
- Mission Operations: 2,000 credits per deployed mission

Factions operate with persistent economy simulating organizational management.
```

### 4. Mission Site Duration Variation by Type
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems provides comprehensive table but API doesn't structure site duration

**Systems Table Shows:**
| Site Type | Typical Duration |
| Crash Site | 7-9 days |
| Scout Post | 5-7 days |
| Harvest Site | 9-12 days |

**API Shows:**
```lua
MissionSite = {
  duration = number, -- Turns until expiration
}
```

**Problem:** API has generic duration but Systems shows site-specific ranges. Should API enforce these?

**Recommendation:** API should validate: "Duration must match Systems table ranges for site type. Crash Site duration must be 7-9 turns."

---

### 5. Alien Race Stat Multiplier Calculation
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Issue:** Systems mentions threat levels but not how race multiplier affects unit stats

**API Shows:**
```lua
AlienRace = {
  base_stats_multiplier = number, -- 1.0 = normal, 1.2 = harder
}
```

**Systems:**
Discusses "threat level" and "intelligence level" but not stat multipliers.

**Problem:** How does `base_stats_multiplier = 1.2` translate to gameplay?
- All stats +20%?
- HP only?
- HP and damage?

Systems should define.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems:
```markdown
**Race Stat Multiplier Effects:**

Base Stats Multiplier applies to all alien unit stats:
- 1.0 = Human baseline (no modification)
- 1.2 = +20% HP, +20% damage, +20% armor
- 1.5 = +50% all stats (elite races)
- 0.8 = -20% all stats (weak races)

Multiplier affects: HP, Damage, Armor, Accuracy, Speed
Does NOT affect: AI behavior, special abilities
```

---

## Minor Gaps (Nice to Fix)

### 6. Story Event Duration Range
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows duration property but Systems doesn't specify typical ranges

**API:**
```lua
StoryEvent = {
  duration = number, -- How long it lasts
}
```

**Systems:**
No mention of event duration specifics.

**Problem:** Are events instant? Last days? Weeks? Examples would help.

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Story Event Duration: Typically 1-7 days (discovery events instant, crisis events 3-7 days)."

---

### 7. Campaign Operation Points System
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API shows campaign points but Systems doesn't explain point accumulation

**API:**
```lua
CampaignOperation = {
  campaign_points = number, -- Points accumulated
}
```

**Systems:**
No campaign points tracking system documented.

**Problem:** What are campaign points? How earned? What do they do?

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "Campaign Points: Each completed mission awards faction 50-200 points toward campaign progress. 1000 points = campaign victory if unopposed."

---

### 8. Alien Race Encounter First Contact Mechanics
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API tracks first encounter but Systems doesn't explain significance

**API:**
```lua
AlienRace = {
  is_encountered = boolean,
  first_encounter_turn = number,
  encounter_mission = string,
}
```

**Systems:**
No first contact event mechanics.

**Problem:** Does first encounter trigger anything special? Story events? Research unlocks?

**Recommendation:** Add to Systems: "First Contact Event: Discovering new alien race unlocks research opportunities and triggers story milestone."

---

### 9. Mission Base Level Progression Timeline Precision
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems provides ranges but not exact formula

**Systems Shows:**
```
Time per Level Advancement: 30-45 days
Growth acceleration: +20% per active mission
Growth deceleration: -30% per assault launched
```

**API:** No progression calculation

**Problem:** Exact formula for level advancement would help implementation.

**Recommendation:** Define formula:
```
Days to Next Level = Base_Days × (1 - Mission_Bonus + Assault_Penalty)
Where:
- Base_Days = 30-45 (randomized per base)
- Mission_Bonus = Active_Missions × 0.20
- Assault_Penalty = Assaults_Launched × 0.30
```

---

### 10. UFO Script Steps Point Award Calculation
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems shows point ranges but not precise formula

**Systems:**
```
Point Award Formula:
Base Points = (UFO Type Base Value) × (Mission Complexity) × (Player Level Factor)
Step Completion = +10-50 points per step
Mission Completion = +50-200 points total
```

**Problem:** What are the actual values for UFO Type Base Value? Mission Complexity? Player Level Factor?

**Recommendation:** Expand formula:
```
UFO Type Base Value: Scout 50, Transport 100, Assault 150, Command 200
Mission Complexity: Simple 1.0×, Medium 1.5×, Complex 2.0×
Player Level Factor: 1.0 + (Organization_Level × 0.1)
```

---

### 11. Quest Duration Ranges by Type
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems provides quest table but duration ranges are broad

**Systems Table:**
| Quest Type | Duration |
| Military | 2-4 weeks |
| Economic | 1-2 months |

**Problem:** More precision would help balance. Why such variation?

**Recommendation:** Tighten ranges or explain: "Duration varies based on difficulty: Easy quests use minimum, Hard quests use maximum of range."

---

### 12. Event Frequency Scaling with Organization Level
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Systems says "2-5 events per month (scales with organization level)" but no formula

**Systems:**
```
Frequency: 2-5 events per month (scales with organization level)
```

**Problem:** How exactly does scaling work?

**Recommendation:** Define: "Event Frequency = 2 + (Organization_Level / 3), capped at 5 events/month. Example: Level 1 = 2 events, Level 9 = 5 events."
