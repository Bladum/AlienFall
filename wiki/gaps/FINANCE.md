2. Clarify country funding calculation details (optional)
3. Specify debt interest rate and repayment terms (optional)

---

---

## Critical Gaps (0)

**No critical gaps identified.** Both documents are well-aligned on core concepts.

---

## Moderate Gaps (4)

### 1. Organization Score Calculation Formula
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Location:** OrganizationScore entity  
**Issue:** API provides score components (military, research, economic, political, strategic) but doesn't specify calculation formula. Systems describes score impact but not calculation.

**API States:**
```lua
OrganizationScore = {
  current_score = number,         -- Overall rating (0-100)
  military_score = number,        -- Combat effectiveness (0-100)
  research_score = number,        -- Tech progress (0-100)
  economic_score = number,        -- Financial health (0-100)
  political_score = number,       -- Country relations (0-100)
  strategic_score = number,       -- Territory control (0-100)
}
```

**Systems States:**
- "Score directly influences country relationships and funding levels"
- "Every 20 points awarded = ±1 relationship modifier"
- Doesn't specify how overall score is calculated from components

**Resolution:** Systems should document:
```
Organization Score = (military × 0.3) + (research × 0.2) + (economic × 0.2) + (political × 0.2) + (strategic × 0.1)
```
Or whatever the actual formula is.

---

### 2. Country Funding Calculation Details
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Location:** Country Funding section  
**Issue:** Systems describes funding conceptually ("percentage of GDP"), but doesn't provide specific formula or GDP values.

**Systems States:**
- "Country economy = sum of all provincial economies"
- "Funding Level 6 = 6% of GDP allocated to defense"
- "Player receives equivalent percentage of country GDP monthly as income"

**Missing:**
- What are typical country GDP values?
- Example: USA GDP = 20,000,000 credits/month, Level 6 = 1,200,000 credits/month?
- How does relationship affect funding level (formula)?

**Resolution:** Systems should provide:
- GDP ranges by country size (small: 1M-5M, large: 10M-50M)
- Funding level formula: `Monthly Funding = (Country GDP) × (Funding Level / 100) × (Relationship Modifier)`
- Relationship to funding level mapping

---

### 3. Score to Relationship Conversion
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Location:** Country Funding → Funding Calculation  
**Issue:** Systems states "Every 20 points awarded = ±1 relationship modifier" but doesn't clarify if this is score or something else.

**Issue:** What generates "points awarded"? Is this:
- Monthly organization score?
- Per-mission score?
- Provincial score accumulation?

**Resolution:** Clarify score-to-relationship formula:
```
Monthly Relationship Change = (Provincial Score This Month / 20) rounded down
```
Or whatever the actual mechanic is.

---

### 4. Debt Interest Accumulation Rate
**Severity:** MODERATE  
**Location:** Debt System section (Systems only)  
**Issue:** Systems states "Interest rate: 5% per month (compounding)" but doesn't specify when interest is calculated or caps.

**Systems States:**
```
- Standard loan: 100,000 Credits per month
- Interest rate: 5% per month (compounding)
- Unpaid debt accrues interest at escalating rates
```

**Missing:**
- Does interest compound daily, weekly, monthly?
- What are "escalating rates" (6%, 7%, 10%)?
- Is there a maximum debt ceiling?
- What happens if debt exceeds available income?

**Resolution:** Systems should specify:
- Interest compounds monthly on total debt
- Escalating rates: 5% → 7% → 10% at thresholds
- Bankruptcy triggers if debt > 10× monthly income

**API Mention:** API doesn't document debt system at all.

**Resolution:** API should add debt tracking or reference Systems.

---

## Minor Gaps (5)

### 5. Income Source Categories
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Both documents list income sources, generally aligned.

**API Lists:**
- Country funding
- Market profit
- Salvage value

**Systems Lists:**
- Country Funding
- Mission Loot Sales
- Raid Loot Sales
- Manufacturing Output
- Faction Tributes
- Supplier Discounts

**Resolution:** Systems has more detailed breakdown. API could add these categories or note they're tracked elsewhere.

### 6. Expense Categories
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** Both documents list expenses, generally aligned.

**API Lists:**
- Base maintenance
- Craft maintenance
- Personnel salary
- Research costs
- Manufacturing costs

**Systems Lists:**
- Equipment Purchases
- Personnel Maintenance
- Facility Maintenance
- Base Operations
- Craft Operations
- Black Market Services
- Diplomacy Costs
- Fame Maintenance
- Corruption Tax
- Inflation Tax

**Resolution:** Systems has more categories. API could expand or note additional tracking.

### 7. Financial Report Period
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API mentions "quarterly" and "annual" reports, Systems mentions "monthly" report.

**Resolution:** Clarify if reports are monthly, quarterly, or both. Likely all three are available.

### 8. Organization Score Rating Labels
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API provides rating strings ("F", "D", "C", "B", "A", "S"), Systems doesn't mention rating labels.

**Resolution:** Systems could document score-to-rating conversion:
```
0-20: F
21-40: D
41-60: C
61-80: B
81-95: A
96-100: S
```

### 9. Transaction Tracking Granularity
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Issue:** API has Transaction entity for individual financial records, Systems doesn't mention transaction-level tracking.

**Resolution:** Acceptable - API provides implementation detail, Systems focuses on aggregated reporting.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (No Critical Gaps)

**No critical gaps require immediate action.** Finance module has excellent alignment.

### Short-Term Actions (Moderate Gaps)

1. **Organization Score Formula:**
   - Add to Systems: Weighted formula for calculating overall score from components
   - Document each component's contribution percentage

2. **Country Funding Details:**
   - Add to Systems: GDP ranges by country size
   - Document funding level calculation formula
   - Provide example calculations

3. **Score-to-Relationship:**
   - Add to Systems: Clear formula for converting monthly score to relationship changes
   - Document thresholds and effects

4. **Debt System:**
   - Add to API: Debt tracking entities and functions
   - Systems should specify interest compounding rules and escalation thresholds
   - Document bankruptcy conditions

### Long-Term Actions (Minor Gaps)

5. Align income/expense category lists between documents
6. Clarify financial report periods (monthly vs quarterly vs annual)
7. Document organization score rating labels in Systems
8. Consider adding transaction tracking to Systems for completeness

## Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent alignment on core concepts (score, funding, income/expense)
- API provides comprehensive entity structure for financial tracking
- Systems provides clear strategic context for score and funding mechanics
- Both documents focused and well-organized
- Clear separation between Finance (historical tracking, scores) and Economy (transactions)

**Weaknesses:**
- Organization score calculation formula not specified
- Country funding formula incomplete (GDP values, relationship effects)
- Debt system in Systems but not API
- Minor category list differences

**Overall:** Excellent alignment. Finance is one of the best-aligned document pairs. Only moderate gaps around specific formulas and the debt system. Much better than AI Systems, Battlescape, or Economy modules. Recommended as template for good API/Systems alignment.
