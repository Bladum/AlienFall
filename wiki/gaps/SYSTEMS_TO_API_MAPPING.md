## How to Use This Reference

1. **Find your mechanic in the left column** (from Systems documentation)
2. **Look across to find which API file documents it** (in the right column)
3. **Check the "Coverage %" column** - gaps marked with ⚠️
4. **Use the Entity column** to find the exact section in the API
