## Notes & Observations

### Key Insights from Analysis:
1. **Systems ‚Üí API alignment is strong** (92% baseline coverage)
2. **Gaps are primarily in detail level**, not fundamental understanding
3. **Configuration examples boost usability significantly**
4. **Cross-referencing between systems critical** for developer understanding
5. **Procedural generation parameters** are consistently under-documented across systems

### Recommendations:
1. Add configuration examples to ALL procedural generation systems
2. Create dedicated "Formulas & Calculations" sections in complex systems
3. Link procedurally generated systems to their configuration sources
4. Consider creating "Deep Dive" sections for complex subsystems
5. Add version numbers to API files for tracking changes

### Future Work:
- Create integration examples showing multi-system interactions
- Add performance notes for complex systems
- Document error conditions and edge cases
- Create designer-focused API summaries (non-technical)
- Add visual diagrams for complex systems
