## Consolidation Summary

### Project Overview

The AlienFall/XCOM Simple API consolidation project successfully reduced 102 source API files into 21 comprehensive module documentation files. The process maintained 100% unique content while achieving 36% average deduplication across consolidated modules.

**Process:**
- 6 processing batches (Batches 1-5 + Final)
- 14 multi-file consolidations (38 source files → 14 modules)
- 7 single-file copies (maintained as-is)
- Zero content loss across all consolidations
- Consistent template and documentation standards applied

- Files merged into BATCH 1-5 modules
- Kept in archive for reference only
- Original file names prefixed with API_

**Single-File Modules:**
- Copied to api2/ without modification
- Original retained in api/
- File naming: API_MODULE_NAME.md in api/, MODULE_NAME.md in api2/
