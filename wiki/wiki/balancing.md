# Balancing

This document describes the automated testing framework for game balance in AlienFall. It covers iterative mini-game simulations, test suites for different game objects, and analytics for identifying and adjusting balance parameters.

## Automated Testing Framework

### Mini-Game Test Loops
Self-contained simulation environments running specific game scenarios in automated loops to test balance parameters.

### Object-Specific Test Suites
Dedicated test configurations for each game object type (units, weapons, items, missions, etc.) with controlled variables.

### Massive Test Execution
Large-scale test runs executing thousands of iterations to gather statistically significant data.

### Result Logging System
Comprehensive logging of all test outcomes, performance metrics, and balance indicators.

### Analytics Engine
Data processing and statistical analysis to identify balance issues and optimal parameter ranges.

### Configuration Insights
Automated suggestions for config changes based on test results and analytics.

## Test Categories by Object Type

### Unit Balancing Tests
- Combat effectiveness vs different enemy types
- Resource efficiency (AP, HP, accuracy)
- Progression curve validation
