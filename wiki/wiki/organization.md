## Player Avatar
Character selected at game start that influences starting bonuses and playstyle.

## Organization Level Progression
Milestone system providing global bonuses, research access, and capabilities as the organization grows from small to very large scale.

## Relationship Systems

### Relations with Suppliers
Affects marketplace availability, prices, and special purchase options. High relations unlock exclusive items, bulk discounts, and priority delivery. Low relations result in inflated prices, limited stock, and potential embargoes.

### Relations with Countries
Influences funding levels, mission access, and diplomatic standing. Positive relations provide increased monthly funding, access to restricted territories, and political support. Negative relations can lead to funding cuts, denied airspace, and hostile diplomatic incidents.

### Relations with Factions
Controls mission generation frequency, difficulty, and faction-specific content access. Good relations increase mission opportunities from that faction, reduce difficulty, and unlock unique research paths. Poor relations decrease mission frequency and increase threat levels.

## Advisors System
Up to 5 high-level specialists providing global boosts in specific areas (research, manufacturing, unit experience, damage, radar coverage, etc.) at very high cost.

## Karma Level
Moral alignment system tracking the ethical nature of player actions and decisions. High karma unlocks benevolent faction missions and bonuses, while low karma provides access to covert operations and black market deals. Actions like civilian casualties reduce karma, while humanitarian missions increase it.

## Fame Level
Public recognition system measuring how well-known and respected the organization is globally. Higher fame levels attract better recruits, improve supplier relations, and unlock media opportunities. Gained through successful missions, research breakthroughs, and public demonstrations of power.

## Reputation System
Overall standing and trustworthiness affecting relationships with all external entities. Reputation influences funding levels, mission availability, and diplomatic negotiations. Maintained through consistent performance, fulfilled contracts, and avoided scandals.

## Score System
Numerical rating system quantifying organizational success and efficiency. Score affects funding multipliers, advisor availability, and endgame achievements. Calculated from mission success rates, research progress, and resource management efficiency.
