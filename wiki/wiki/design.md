## Vision & Goals
- Open-ended strategic gameplay inspired by X-COM series
- Massive scale progression from small company to interplanetary military organization
- Faction-based lore resolution through research and campaigns

## Game Layer Analogies
- **Battlescape**: Roguelike gameplay at squad level with tactical combat
- **Basescape**: Sim City-style base management and facility construction
- **Interception**: Card game mechanics for UFO engagement and resource allocation
- **Geoscape**: Risk/Europa Universalis-style global strategy and territorial control
- **Economy**: Civilization series resource management and trade systems

## Open-Endedness
- No fixed victory conditions or game-ending scenarios
- Infinite progression through continuous mission generation
- Research completion triggers new content waves instead of ending the game
- Player-driven pacing and goals

## Replayability
- Everything is procedurally generated like missions, campaigns, maps for battle
- Due to massive size of content in mods, in most cases player will see entire content in single game

## Faction System
- Each faction represents individual lore arcs resolved through campaigns
- Technology research paths reveal faction backstories and motivations
- Final research removes factions from campaign generation
- Failed research leads to escalating mission difficulty (tower defense-style)

## Organizational Progression
- **Starting Point**: Small company with few personnel
- **Growth Stages**: 4-5 organizational upgrade levels
- **Endgame Scale**: Military organization capable of interplanetary operations
  - Up to 12 bases worldwide
  - 100+ combat units
  - 20+ aircraft/crafts
- Massive scaling in both quality (technology) and quantity (resources/units)

## Automation Systems
- Optional automation of routine tasks to focus on preferred gameplay aspects
- Delegate base management, resource gathering, or combat operations
- Maintain player agency while reducing micromanagement fatigue

## Difficulty Scaling
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard, Ironman)
- Dynamic scaling of enemy stats, resources, and mission complexity
- Adaptive AI based on player performance

## Progression
- Soldier leveling, skill trees, and stat growth
- Research tree unlocks and tech progression
- Campaign milestones and achievements
- Veteran rewards and unlocks

## Endgame
- Post-campaign content (endless mode, new game plus)
- Multiple endings based on player choices
- Replay value through randomization and branching paths

## Game Loops

### Time Scale Structure
- **Battle Level**: 1 turn = 10 seconds (real-time tactical combat)
- **Interception Level**: 1 turn = few minutes (UFO engagement mechanics)
- **Geoscape Level**: 1 turn = 1 day (strategic world management)
- **Geoscape Extended**: Weeks, months, quarters for long-term planning

### Immediate Loop (Tactical)
- Battlescape combat rounds (10-second turns)
- Real-time decision making under pressure
- Squad-level tactical positioning and actions

### Short-Term Loop (Base Ops)
- Interception missions (multi-minute engagements)
- Base facility management and construction
- Resource allocation and personnel assignment

### Medium-Term Loop (Monthly)
- Geoscape strategic planning (daily turns)
- Mission planning and deployment
- Research project advancement
- Economic planning and trade

### Long-Term Loop (Campaign)
- Multi-year strategic campaigns (5-15 year total playtime)
- Faction research and technology progression
- Organizational expansion and upgrades
- Interplanetary operations and colonization

### Pacing & Escalation
- Consistent timescale across all game worlds
- Potential time travel technology for advanced gameplay
- Escalating difficulty as factions grow unchecked
- Open-ended progression with no time pressure
