## Resistance of Armour
Damage reduction percentages against different attack types and intensities.
Resistnace is for 
    kinetic
    explosive
    laser
    plasma
    melee
    stun
    smoke
    psi
    warp
    etc
Unit with armour might be more or less resistnace with armour
ALl resistance is snap to 20% step (80% / 160% etc)

## Armour Piercing Mechanics
Penetration calculations for weapons that can bypass protective systems.
Some weapon may penetrate armour value
This does not impact armour resistance

## Armour Sides
Directional protection varying by frontal, side, and rear armor values.
At the moment this is not used. Armour has values the same for all unit sides. 

## Armour desintagration
At the moment armour cannot lose its armour value during battle, we can only pierce it.

## Armour during battle
Units cannot change armour during battle - assumption

## Inbuilt Armour for Unit
Natural or cybernetic protection integrated into soldier physiology.
Armour slot is not available for unit as it has un-build armour and cannot change it

## Passive Skills from Armour
Automatic abilities granted by wearing specific armor types.
To agreed how to do it.

## Unit/Craft Stats Bonuses
Armor-provided modifiers to mobility, durability, or special capabilities.
Armour itself weight a lot and first check is done is unit can use it
But once it on it will provide bonus to all units stats like strenght for power armour

## Armour dependency
Some armours may required specific unit class to wear, or race, or trait or transformation
