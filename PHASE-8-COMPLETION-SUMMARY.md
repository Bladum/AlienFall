# PHASE 8 COMPLETION SUMMARY - Campaign Outcome Handling

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Phase:** Phase 8 of TASK-025 Geoscape Master Implementation
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~8 hours (1 session)

---

## 🎯 Phase 8 Overview

Phase 8 implements complete campaign outcome handling, closing the feedback loop between battlescape missions and campaign state management. After missions end, outcomes are processed, casualties handled, crafts repaired, units progress, difficulty escalates, and salvage is collected - all integrating seamlessly with existing geoscape systems.

## 🚀 What's Working

### Complete Campaign Outcome Loop
When a mission ends, the system now:
1. Records mission outcome (victory/defeat/retreat)
2. Processes casualties and wounded units
3. Records unit kills and experiences for progression
4. Applies unit rank advancement and medals
5. Records craft damage and schedules repairs
6. Calculates repair costs and time
7. Processes salvage collection
8. Extracts materials from alien corpses
9. Calculates mission rewards and reputation changes
10. Updates campaign threat level
11. Adjusts alien activity for next missions

### Adaptive Difficulty System
- Win rate tracked and used to adjust threat
- Higher threat increases mission frequency and difficulty
- Enemy composition becomes more advanced at higher threats
- UFO activity scales with threat (more crafts, higher intercept rate)
- Base assault probability increases with threat
- Time-based escalation ensures long games get harder

### Complete Recovery System
- Wounded units recover over multiple days
- Medical facilities reduce recovery time
- Sanity damage tracked and healed
- Multiple wounds stack and slow overall recovery
- Units unavailable while recovering
- Recovery time varies by injury severity

### Equipment & Materials
- Salvage items have condition-based values
- Materials extracted from alien corpses
- Inventory management with volume constraints
- Research opportunities unlock from alien tech
- Crafting recipes become available from research

---

## 🎓 Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
Each system is independent and can be updated without affecting others:
- Mission outcomes don't depend on recovery system
- Difficulty escalation doesn't depend on salvage processing
- Craft return is independent of unit progression

### Extensibility
All core values are configurable:
- Repair costs/times in CraftReturnSystem
- Recovery rates in UnitRecoveryProgression
- Threat calculations in DifficultyEscalation
- Salvage values in SalvageProcessor

### Data-Driven
Systems use tables for configuration:
- Material yields per species
- Repair costs per damage type
- Item volumes for inventory
- Threat-based adjustments

### Nil-Safe
All systems handle missing data gracefully:
- Optional parameters with defaults
- Checking for nil before using values
- Fallback values for missing configuration
