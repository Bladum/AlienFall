## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Patterns

**1. Data Bridge Pattern**
- CampaignGeoscapeIntegration acts as bridge between systems
- Decouples campaign from geoscape implementation details
- Enables independent evolution of both systems

**2. Command Pattern**
- Mission actions (Accept/Decline/Delay) as discrete commands
- Commands propagate through integration layer
- Easy to audit and track changes

**3. State Machine Pattern**
- Mission goes through states: Available → Selected → Deployed → Completed
- Transition system manages state changes
- Clear state validation at each step

**4. Adapter Pattern**
- DeploymentIntegration adapts deployment screen to campaign data
- Converts campaign entities to deployment format
- Handles data transformation and validation

### Data Serialization

All modules support complete state serialization:
- Mission selection state preserved
- Squad configuration saved
- Deployment settings persisted
- Full recovery on load

### Error Handling

Comprehensive validation at each step:
- Squad capacity checks
- Craft availability verification
- Mission state validation
- Equipment weight limits
- Deployment readiness checks
