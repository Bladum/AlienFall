## Planning Fundamentals

### ‚úÖ DO: Define Clear Acceptance Criteria

**Every task needs SMART criteria:**

```markdown
# Task: Implement Sniper Unit Type

## Goal
Add sniper unit to game with distinct tactical role (high damage, slow reload).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Stats defined: 60 damage, 85 accuracy, 3s reload
- [x] Sprite created (24x24 pixel art)
- [x] Unit can be spawned in battlescape
- [x] Stats display correctly in UI
- [x] All 5 balance tests pass
- [x] Performance benchmark shows <1ms per sniper update
- [x] No console errors in 10-minute gameplay session
- [x] Works correctly with other weapon types
- [x] Documentation updated in units/README.md
- [x] Code reviewed and approved

## Definition of "Done"
- Builds without warnings
- All tests pass
- Works on target hardware
- Code reviewed
- Documented
```

**Why specific criteria matter:**
- Prevents ambiguity
- Makes review easier
- Defines "done" objectively
- Helps with estimation

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Estimate with Uncertainty

**Don't estimate as single number. Use ranges:**

```markdown
# Task Estimates

## Bad Estimation
"Implementation: 2 days"
(Too specific, usually wrong)

## Good Estimation
"Implementation: 2-3 days (with 2 days risk buffer)"
- Optimistic: 1.5 days (if everything goes smoothly)
- Realistic: 2 days (with 1-2 complications)
- Pessimistic: 3.5 days (if major issues found)
- Risk buffer: 2 days (account for unknowns)
- Total: 3-5.5 days

## Recommendation
"Start: 2 days. Revisit if > 2.5 days without major progress."
```

---

### ‚ùå DON'T: Commit to "Rough Estimates" as Final

**Problem:** Initial estimates often 30-50% off. They improve with research.

```markdown
# Better Estimation Process

## Phase 1: Initial Rough Estimate (1 hour)
"Looks like 3-5 days"

## Phase 2: Spike/Research (4 hours)
- Investigate unknown areas
- Check existing code patterns
- Ask experienced people

## Phase 3: Refined Estimate (2 hours)
"Actually: 2-4 days after investigating"

## Phase 4: Planning (1 hour)
"Let's plan it as: 3 days, with risks known"
```

---

## Breaking Down Features

### ‚úÖ DO: Use User Story Mapping

**Large feature broken into stories:**

```markdown
# Feature: Battlescape Difficulty Scaling

## Epic: Dynamic Difficulty System
Adjust mission difficulty based on player performance.

### Story 1: Capture Player Performance Data
- Track wins/losses per difficulty
- Record player casualty rates
- Store data in save file
- Estimate: 2-3 days

### Story 2: Calculate Recommended Difficulty  
- Analyze performance trends
- Suggest difficulty adjustment
- Add suggestion to UI
- Estimate: 1-2 days

### Story 3: Implement Difficulty Effects
- Adjust enemy unit count
- Modify enemy AI aggression
- Change mission rewards
- Estimate: 2-3 days

### Story 4: Testing & Balance
- Test all difficulty levels
- Gather player feedback
- Adjust thresholds
- Estimate: 2 days

## Total: 7-10 days
```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Define Task Dependencies

```markdown
# Dependency Graph

```
Player Performance Tracking (2-3 days)
  ‚Üì (needs data)
Difficulty Calculation (1-2 days)
  ‚Üì (needs formula)
Difficulty Effects (2-3 days)
  ‚Üì (parallel: Testing, Balance tuning)
QA & Balance (2 days)
  ‚Üì
Complete
```

**Key insight:** Can't do Difficulty Calculation without Performance Data.

---

## Task Estimation

### ‚úÖ DO: Use Planning Poker

**Team-based estimation improves accuracy:**

1. Read story aloud
2. Each person secretly estimates (1-13)
3. Reveal: If close, that's estimate. If divergent, discuss why.
4. Re-estimate with new info

```markdown
# Example Estimation

Story: "Implement damage falloff system"

Round 1 Votes:
- Person A: 3 days (familiar with physics)
- Person B: 8 days (hasn't done this)
- Person C: 5 days

Discussion:
- A: "Physics is straightforward, just distance formula"
- B: "But we need to integrate with existing damage calc"
- C: "And need extensive testing"

Round 2 Votes:
- Person A: 4 days (accounting for integration)
- Person B: 6 days (convinced it's less than thought)
- Person C: 5 days

Consensus: 5 days
```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Track Estimation Accuracy

```markdown
# Estimation Accuracy Report

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Ratio |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit pooling | 3 days | 2.5 days | 83% |
| UI redesign | 5 days | 7 days | 140% |
| Balance tuning | 2 days | 3 days | 150% |
| Pathfinding | 4 days | 3.5 days | 88% |
| **Average** | | | **115%** |

Insights:
- Underestimate: Complex systems, cross-cutting concerns
- Accurate: Well-defined tasks in familiar areas
- Pattern: Add 15% buffer to estimates
```

---

### ‚ùå DON'T: Pad Estimates for Pressure

**Bad:** Estimating 5 days because manager says "need it in 3"

**Reality:** False estimates lead to:
- Broken promises
- Crunch
- Lower quality
- Team burnout

**Better:**
- Estimate honestly
- Scope down if timeline firm
- Adjust timeline if scope firm
- Communicate tradeoffs clearly

---

## Scope Management

### ‚úÖ DO: Manage Scope Creep

**Scope creep kills projects. Track it:**

```markdown
# Scope Management Log

## Feature: Sniper Unit

### Original Scope
- [ ] Unit stats
- [ ] Sprite
- [ ] Integration
**Estimate: 3 days**

### Scope Creep Attempts (REJECTED)
- ‚ùå "Can we add ghillie suit variants?" ‚Üí NO (separate feature)
- ‚ùå "Can we add team sniper bonuses?" ‚Üí NO (defer to v1.1)
- ‚ùå "Can we add scoped view?" ‚Üí NO (too much scope creep)
- ‚ùå "Can we balance against all 15 unit types?" ‚Üí PARTIAL (core types only)

### Scope Creep Allowed (JUSTIFIED)
- ‚úÖ "Need counter-ability for sniper overpower risk" ‚Üí Added (scope justified)

### Final Scope (stays as planned)
**Estimate: 3 days** (no change)
```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Use "Parking Lot" for Ideas

```markdown
# Project: Battlescape AI

## Current Sprint (Oct 16 - Oct 30)
- [x] Implement flanking tactics
- [x] Add suppression system
- [ ] (in progress) Balance enemy squads

## Parking Lot (Future Features)
- "Squad retreat mechanics" ‚Üí v1.3
- "AI learning from player" ‚Üí v2.0
- "Dynamic difficulty" ‚Üí v1.2
- "Commander override orders" ‚Üí Backlog

This parking lot prevents scope creep while capturing ideas.
```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

```markdown
# MVP vs. Final Feature

## MVP: Sniper Unit (what we MUST ship)
- Sprite: basic soldier with rifle
- Stats: higher damage than soldier
- Integration: works in existing battle system
- **Effort: 2 days**

## v1.1 Additions (what we CAN add later)
- Unique sniper sprite (gillie suit)
- Scoped view mode
- Unique animations
- **Effort: 3 days**

## v2.0 Additions (future versions)
- Team bonuses for sniper pairs
- Counter-sniper mechanics
- Customization

Strategy: Ship MVP fast, iterate based on feedback.
```

---

## Sprint Planning

### ‚úÖ DO: Capacity-Based Planning

```markdown
# Sprint Planning Oct 16-30 (2 weeks)

## Team Capacity
- Person A: 10 days (full time)
- Person B: 5 days (part-time)

```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Track Burndown

```markdown
# Sprint Burndown Oct 16-30

Day 1 (Oct 16): 120 hours remaining ‚Üí start
Day 2 (Oct 17): 114 hours remaining ‚Üí on track
Day 3 (Oct 18): 110 hours remaining ‚Üí on track
Day 5 (Oct 21): 95 hours remaining ‚Üí good progress
Day 7 (Oct 23): 88 hours remaining ‚Üí slight slip (3 hours)
Day 8 (Oct 24): 75 hours remaining ‚Üí caught up
Day 10 (Oct 28): 35 hours remaining ‚Üí on track
Day 11 (Oct 29): 10 hours remaining ‚Üí good
Day 12 (Oct 30): 0 hours remaining ‚Üí DONE!

Pattern: Slight mid-sprint dip (normal), recovered well.
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ DO: Identify Risks Early

```markdown
# Risk Assessment

## High Risk Items

### Risk: New AI Squad Tactics (Est. 4 days)
- **Issue:** Unproven algorithm, unknown complexity
- **Probability:** 60% (will hit issues)
- **Impact:** High (core feature)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Do spike research first (2 days)
  - Implement simple version first, enhance later
  - Plan for 5-6 days instead of 4
- **Owner:** Person A

### Risk: Save Game Format Migration (Est. 3 days)
- **Issue:** Must support v3 and v4 formats
- **Probability:** 70% (always has issues)
- **Impact:** Very High (can break saves)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on existing v3 saves
  - Test on v4 test cases
  - Have rollback plan
  - Plan for 4-5 days instead of 3
- **Owner:** Person B

## Medium Risk Items
(Similar analysis for each)
```

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Have Contingency Plans

```markdown
# Contingency Plans

## If Squad AI Takes Longer Than Expected
Plan A (first choice): Reduce AI complexity, defer advanced tactics to v1.1
Plan B (if A not viable): Reduce other tasks, extend AI time
Plan C (fallback): Ship with basic AI only, iterate post-release

## If Save Migration Breaks Existing Saves
Plan A (first choice): Rollback format, fix code
Plan B (if A not viable): Auto-migrate and validate
Plan C (fallback): Ask players to reset (bad option, last resort)
```

---

## Dependencies & Blocking

### ‚úÖ DO: Map Dependencies Visually

```markdown
# Dependency Map

```
Core Entity System (DONE)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Unit Types (3 days)
  ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí AI System (4 days)
  ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Squad Tactics (2 days) ‚Üí FINAL
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Weapon System (2 days)
  ‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Balance Testing (2 days)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí UI System (2 days)
```

**Critical path:** Entity ‚Üí Unit Types ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Squad Tactics (11 days minimum)

**Non-critical:** UI can happen in parallel.

---

### ‚úÖ DO: Unblock Explicitly

```markdown
# Blocking Issues

## Blocked: Weapon Balance (blocked by AI system)
- Task: Balance weapon damage
- Blocked by: AI system not complete
- Blocker owner: Person A
- Expected unblock date: Oct 25
- Workaround: Use placeholder AI stats for testing
- Assigned: Person B (waiting on Person A)
```

---

## Prioritization Frameworks

### ‚úÖ DO: Use RICE Scoring

```markdown
# RICE Prioritization

## RICE = Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence / Effort

### Feature: Dynamic Difficulty
- Reach: 80% of players
- Impact: 3 (very high - affects retention)
- Confidence: 60% (some uncertainty)
- Effort: 3 person-weeks
- **RICE: 80 √ó 3 √ó 0.6 / 3 = 48**

### Feature: Weapon Cosmetics
- Reach: 100% (all players)
- Impact: 1 (low - cosmetic)
- Confidence: 100%
- Effort: 2 person-weeks
- **RICE: 100 √ó 1 √ó 1 / 2 = 50**

### Feature: Campaign Mode
- Reach: 100% (all players)
- Impact: 4 (critical feature)
- Confidence: 70%
- Effort: 8 person-weeks
- **RICE: 100 √ó 4 √ó 0.7 / 8 = 35**

## Priority Order (by RICE score)
1. Weapon Cosmetics (50)
2. Dynamic Difficulty (48)
3. Campaign Mode (35)

Note: Cosmetics ranks high despite low impact because so easy (great ROI).
```

## Capacity Planning

### ‚úÖ DO: Plan Realistic Hours

```markdown
# Realistic Capacity Calculation

## Team Member: 40 hour/week full-time

### Time Allocation
- Coding/Implementation: 25 hours/week (63%)
- Code review/meetings: 8 hours/week (20%)
- Debugging/unexpected: 5 hours/week (12%)
- Breaks, lunch, misc: 2 hours/week (5%)
- **Total: 40 hours**

### Net Productive Time Per Week
25 hours (not 40!)

## For 2-Week Sprint
25 hours/week √ó 2 weeks = **50 hours available**

## Common Mistake
Assigning 80 hours of work (40 hours √ó 2 weeks) instead of 50.
Result: Tasks get delayed, team frustrated.
```

---

## Tracking Progress

### ‚úÖ DO: Track with Certainty Levels

```markdown
# Progress Tracking

## Story: "Implement Squad Tactics AI"

### Week 1
- Status: 40% done
- Certainty: "Pretty sure" - still investigating
- Risks identified: Algorithm complexity higher than thought
- Revised estimate: 4 days ‚Üí 5 days
- Action: Continue investigation

### Week 2
- Status: 75% done
- Certainty: "Very confident" - core algorithm working
- Remaining: Testing, balance, edge cases
- On track: Yes, will finish on time (adjusted estimate)
- Action: Code review ready mid-week

### End of Sprint
- Status: 100% done
- Certainty: "Done-done" - all tests pass, reviewed, merged
- Actual time: 4.8 days (within adjusted estimate)
```

---

## Handling Changes

### ‚úÖ DO: Change Management Process

```markdown
# Change Request: "Add Thermal Vision to Sniper"

## Step 1: Document Request
- **Requestor:** Designer
- **Description:** Sniper can toggle thermal imaging to see heat signatures
- **Why:** Would make sniper more unique and powerful
- **When needed:** "Soon" (vague)

## Step 2: Impact Analysis
- **Scope impact:** +2 days (new UI, new mechanic)
- **Performance impact:** +5% GPU time (thermal overlay)
- **Balance impact:** Sniper becomes 30% stronger
- **Risk:** Might make sniper overpowered

## Step 3: Decision
- **Decision:** DEFER TO V1.1
- **Reason:** Current sprint at capacity, good for post-release iteration
- **Alternative:** Could reduce another feature instead
- **Communicat: "Great idea! Let's do it post-release based on player feedback"

## Step 4: Document Decision
- Added to "Parking Lot" for v1.1 planning
- Decision logged in DECISIONS.md
```

---

## Team Communication

### ‚úÖ DO: Status Updates for Transparency

```markdown
# Sprint Status Update - Week 1 (Oct 16-20)

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Pathfinding corner case fix (3 days) - ON TIME
- ‚úÖ Sniper unit sprite (0.5 days) - EARLY

## In Progress
- üîÑ Sniper unit stats/integration (1.5 of 2.5 days) - ON TRACK
- üîÑ New weapon type (1 of 2 days) - SLIGHT SLIP (0.5 days)

## Blocked
- ‚è∏Ô∏è AI balance testing (blocked by AI system, expected unblock: Oct 25)

## Risks Identified
- Animation system more complex than expected (estimate: 4 ‚Üí 5 days)
- Mid-sprint review: Still on track overall

## Next Week Plans
- Complete sniper integration
- Start animation improvements
- Begin balance testing once AI ready
```

---

## Planning for AI Agents

### ‚úÖ DO: Clear Handoff Documents

```markdown
# Handoff Document for AI Agent

## Current Sprint Status
- Progress: 60% complete
- Timeline: On track for Oct 30 release
- Major blocker: None currently

## What's Planned Next
1. Complete weapon balance testing (2 days) - START NOW
2. Add new unit type (3 days) - START AFTER BALANCE
3. Performance optimization (2 days) - PARALLEL TRACK

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Task: Complete Weapon Balance Testing (2 days)

**What needs to be done:**
- Test sniper vs. 5 common unit types
- Log win/loss/casualty rates
- Identify overpowered/underpowered combinations
- Adjust damage values if needed

**How to approach:**
- See docs/GAME_NUMBERS.md for current balance values
- See tests/balance/weapons_test.lua for existing tests
- Add 10+ test scenarios per weapon pair
- Document findings in BALANCE_REPORT.md

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All 5 unit types tested vs sniper
- [ ] Balance report completed
- [ ] Damage adjustments made if needed
- [ ] All tests pass

**Known risks:**
- Might discover sniper is overpowered
- Might require recursive balancing (if we nerf sniper, soldier becomes weak)

**When stuck:**
- Balance questions: Ask @designer
- Code questions: See weapon balancing examples in weapons.lua line 234-256
- Testing: Use debug mode (press D)

**Success looks like:**
- Sniper has <55% win rate vs other units (balanced)
- No unit type counters sniper 90%+ (would be unfair)
```

## Common Planning Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake: Estimating Without Information

**Bad:** "Complex AI system: 5 days" (without research)

**Better:**
- Spike 1 day: Research existing patterns, investigate complexity
- Refined estimate: 7 days (with new info)

---

### ‚ùå Mistake: No Scope Definition

**Bad:** "Add difficulty scaling" (vague)

**Better:** "Add difficulty scaling: track player performance, suggest difficulty, adjust enemy count/AI aggression" (specific)

---

### ‚ùå Mistake: Ignoring Risk

**Bad:** Estimating 3 days for risky feature with 70% failure probability

**Better:** Estimating 4-5 days, planning contingency

---

### ‚ùå Mistake: Over-Committing Capacity

**Bad:** 15 capacity days but 20 days of work planned

**Better:** Plan 12-14 days work in 15 available (leave buffer)

---

## Planning Checklist

- [ ] Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
- [ ] Estimate with ranges and uncertainty
- [ ] Break features into smaller stories
- [ ] Identify dependencies and blocking
- [ ] Assess risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Plan capacity realistically (not maximum hours)
- [ ] Track and communicate progress
- [ ] Leave buffer for unexpected issues
- [ ] Have contingency plans
- [ ] Document decisions and scope decisions
- [ ] Review estimation accuracy
- [ ] Update plans based on learnings
