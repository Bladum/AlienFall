   - 🎨 = Visual Assets (Pixel Art, UI/UX)
   - 🔌 = Extensibility/Modding
   - 🧪 = Quality Assurance
   - ⚔️ = Tactical Combat
   - 📐 = Architecture

### Reading Instructions

**Recommended order**:
1. Start with domain-specific `.instructions.md` file
2. Use Table of Contents for quick navigation
3. Reference DO/DON'T examples for practical guidance
4. Check Related sections for connected topics
