**Use this to track progress through each phase**

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

- **Total Phases**: 4
- **Total Time**: 9-13 hours
- **Priority**: Phase 1 is CRITICAL (do first)
- **Complexity**: HIGH (many cross-references to update)

---

## üî¥ PHASE 1: CODE HYGIENE (2-3 hours) - CRITICAL ‚≠ê

**Goal:** Remove code from design docs, create technical folder

### Step 1.1: Create Technical Folder
- [ ] Create `docs/technical/` folder
- [ ] Create `docs/technical/README.md`
  - [ ] Explain purpose: Large technical analysis and implementation guides
  - [ ] List contents
  - [ ] Link to design docs they relate to

### Step 1.2: Extract Code from TILESET_SYSTEM.md (50-60 min)
- [ ] Read current file: `docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md` (825 lines)
- [ ] Create new file: `docs/technical/TILESET_SYSTEM.md` (copy of original)
  - [ ] Keep all code blocks and TOML examples
  - [ ] Keep all technical details
- [ ] Update original: `docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md`
  - [ ] REMOVE all TOML code blocks (12 of them)
  - [ ] REMOVE all Lua code blocks (7 of them)
  - [ ] REPLACE with text descriptions
    - Example: "The tileset format defines a structure with fields for tileset name, tile count, and variant modes"
  - [ ] Add note at top: "‚Üí Technical implementation: See `docs/technical/TILESET_SYSTEM.md`"
- [ ] Update cross-references:
  - [ ] Find files linking to this file
  - [ ] Update to point to technical version if technical reference
  - [ ] Keep design doc reference if design context

### Step 1.3: Extract Code from FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md (30-40 min)
- [ ] Read current file: `docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md` (334 lines)
- [ ] Create new file: `docs/technical/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md`
  - [ ] Copy all code blocks
- [ ] Update original:
  - [ ] REMOVE all Lua code blocks (6 of them)
  - [ ] REPLACE with text descriptions
  - [ ] Add cross-reference note
- [ ] Update cross-references in other docs

### Step 1.4: Extract Code from RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md (30-40 min)
- [ ] Read current file: `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` (656 lines)
- [ ] Create new file: `docs/technical/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`
  - [ ] Copy all code blocks
- [ ] Update original:
  - [ ] REMOVE all Lua code blocks (7 of them)
  - [ ] REPLACE with text descriptions
  - [ ] Add cross-reference note
- [ ] Update cross-references in other docs

### Step 1.5: Remove Code from TESTING.md (20-30 min)
- [ ] Read current file: `docs/testing/TESTING.md`
- [ ] Identify all Lua code blocks
- [ ] For each code block:
  - [ ] Determine what it demonstrates
  - [ ] Write text description instead
  - [ ] Link to actual test implementation in `tests/` if needed
- [ ] Update file with descriptions only

### Step 1.6: Update Cross-References (20-30 min)
- [ ] Search for all references to moved/updated files:
  - [ ] `docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md` ‚Üí may need to update
  - [ ] `docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md` ‚Üí may need to update
  - [ ] `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` ‚Üí may need to update
- [ ] Update files:
  - [ ] `docs/README.md`
  - [ ] `docs/QUICK_NAVIGATION.md`
  - [ ] `docs/API.md`
  - [ ] Any design docs linking to these files

### Validation for Phase 1
- [ ] No Lua code blocks remain in design docs
- [ ] No TOML code blocks remain in design docs
- [ ] All code moved to `docs/technical/`
- [ ] All cross-references updated
- [ ] README created in `docs/technical/`
- [ ] All files still linkable

**Time: 2-3 hours**  
**Impact: HIGH** ‚≠ê (Standards compliance)

## üü† PHASE 2: FOLDER REORGANIZATION (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Fix folder duplication, consolidate confusing structures

### Step 2.1: Consolidate balance/ and balancing/ (30-45 min)
- [ ] Rename folder:
  - [ ] Move `docs/balancing/` ‚Üí `docs/balance/testing/`
  - [ ] Move `docs/balancing/framework.md` ‚Üí `docs/balance/testing/framework.md`
- [ ] Create README files:
  - [ ] Create `docs/balance/README.md`
    - [ ] Explain: balance/ folder contains game balance documentation and testing
    - [ ] Explain subfolders: GAME_NUMBERS.md (design), testing/ (framework)
  - [ ] Create `docs/balance/testing/README.md`
    - [ ] Explain: Testing framework for balance validation

  - [ ] `docs/README.md`
  - [ ] Any other docs referencing old path

### Step 2.2: Clarify docs/economy/ Structure (45-60 min)
- [ ] Investigate subfolders:
  - [ ] Check: `docs/economy/research/` - has content?
  - [ ] Check: `docs/economy/production/` - has content?
  - [ ] Check: `docs/economy/marketplace/` - has content?
  - [ ] Check: `docs/economy/finance/` - has content?
- [ ] **Option A: If empty** - Remove them
  - [ ] `rm docs/economy/research/` (keep only research.md)
  - [ ] `rm docs/economy/production/` (keep only manufacturing.md)
  - [ ] `rm docs/economy/marketplace/` (keep only marketplace.md)
  - [ ] Rename `finance/` ‚Üí `funding/` for clarity
- [ ] **Option B: If has content** - Reorganize
  - [ ] Create structure:
    ```
    docs/economy/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (NEW)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research.md ‚Üí move to research/research.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manufacturing.md ‚Üí move to production/manufacturing.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ marketplace.md ‚Üí move to marketplace/marketplace.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ funding.md
    ```
  - [ ] Create README in each subfolder explaining contents
  - [ ] Create main `docs/economy/README.md` explaining structure
- [ ] Create `docs/economy/README.md` regardless:

---

## üü¢ PHASE 4: STANDARDIZE & VALIDATE (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Final polish and validation

### Step 4.1: Fix File Naming (30-45 min)
- [ ] Review current naming convention
- [ ] Identify inconsistencies:
  - [ ] Root level: README.md, OVERVIEW.md, QUICK_NAVIGATION.md (‚úÖ OK - keep UPPERCASE)
  - [ ] Design docs: research.md, missions.md (‚úÖ OK - keep lowercase)
  - [ ] Technical docs: TILESET_SYSTEM.md (‚úÖ OK - UPPERCASE for technical/)
  - [ ] Problem files: Identify and note
- [ ] For each inconsistency:
  - [ ] Decide: Should it be UPPERCASE or lowercase?
  - [ ] Rename file
  - [ ] Update all cross-references
- [ ] Document convention in `docs/README.md`

### Step 4.2: Consolidate Navigation Files (20-30 min)
- [ ] Review:
  - [ ] `docs/README.md` - Folder intro
  - [ ] `docs/OVERVIEW.md` - Game overview
  - [ ] `docs/QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` - Index (355 lines - too long?)
  - [ ] `docs/API.md` - Technical reference
- [ ] Decide:
  - [ ] Keep QUICK_NAVIGATION.md? (useful extended reference)
  - [ ] Archive it? (move to docs/references/?)
  - [ ] Merge with README.md? (if too much overlap)
- [ ] If consolidating:
  - [ ] Update `docs/README.md` to include navigation tips
  - [ ] Keep QUICK_NAVIGATION as optional extended reference
  - [ ] Add comment: "Quick links above; see QUICK_NAVIGATION for complete index"
- [ ] Update top-level file links:
  - [ ] Make sure links between navigation files are clear
  - [ ] Add "Start here:" guidance for new users

### Step 4.3: Validate All Cross-References (20-30 min)
- [ ] Check each major file:
  - [ ] `docs/README.md` - All links work?
  - [ ] `docs/OVERVIEW.md` - All links work?
  - [ ] `docs/QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` - All links work?
  - [ ] `docs/API.md` - All links work?
- [ ] Check each folder:
  - [ ] All READMEs have valid links to implementation/tests
  - [ ] All links use consistent relative path format
  - [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- [ ] Optional: Create validation script to check links automatically

### Step 4.4: Final Quality Check (10-15 min)
- [ ] Folder structure is clean and logical ‚úÖ
- [ ] No files with embedded code (except technical/) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Every folder has README with clear purpose ‚úÖ
- [ ] File naming is consistent ‚úÖ
- [ ] Navigation is clear and accessible ‚úÖ
- [ ] All cross-references work ‚úÖ
- [ ] No duplicate folders ‚úÖ
- [ ] No confusing subfolder structures ‚úÖ

### Validation for Phase 4
- [ ] File naming consistent throughout
- [ ] Navigation files clear and non-overlapping
- [ ] All cross-references validated and working
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Final structure review complete and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated with new organization

**Time: 1-2 hours**  
**Impact: LOW-MEDIUM** (Polish, professional appearance)

## üö® COMMON GOTCHAS

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cross-references**: Remember to update ALL files linking to moved files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Relative paths**: Make sure new relative paths are correct from new location
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Git**: If using git, make sure moves are done as renames, not delete+create
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Case sensitivity**: Windows is case-insensitive but be consistent anyway
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Subfolders**: Check if subfolders have content before deleting/moving
