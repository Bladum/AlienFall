# Deep Analysis: AlienFall Documentation Structure
## Recommendations for Improvement, Reorganization, and Deduplication

**Analysis Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Analyzed By:** AI Documentation Auditor  
**Total Files Analyzed:** 60+ markdown files across docs/ folder  

---

## Executive Summary

The documentation structure is **well-organized but suffers from**:
- ‚úÖ **Strengths**: Clear hierarchical structure, comprehensive coverage, good README files
- ‚ùå **Issues**: Code/TOML embedded in design docs, folder duplication, unclear folder purposes, navigation redundancy
- üîß **Improvements Needed**: 8 major reorganization tasks, 15+ file consolidations

### Quick Stats
- **Total .md files in docs/**: ~55 files
- **Files with embedded Lua code**: 8+ files (should be removed from design docs)
- **Files with TOML examples**: 12+ in TILESET_SYSTEM.md (should be converted to descriptions)
- **Folder duplication pairs**: 3 pairs with overlapping purposes
- **Navigation/Index files**: 4 files with similar content (README, OVERVIEW, QUICK_NAVIGATION, API)
- **Reorganization complexity**: HIGH (affects 20+ files, requires careful linking)

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Code/TOML Embedded in Design Documentation (VIOLATION OF STANDARDS)

**Problem:** Design docs should contain ONLY game design concepts, not code or configuration examples.

**Affected Files:**

| File | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `docs/testing/TESTING.md` | Multiple `lua` code blocks | Replace with descriptions of what code does |
| `docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md` | 6 `lua` code blocks | Move code to engine/, link to actual implementation |
| `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` | 7 `lua` code blocks | Convert to conceptual descriptions |
| `docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md` | **12 TOML + 7 Lua blocks** | Major issue - convert all to text descriptions |
| `docs/core/LUA_BEST_PRACTICES.md` | 15+ lua blocks (APPROPRIATE) | Keep - this is technical documentation |
| `docs/core/LUA_DOCSTRING_GUIDE.md` | Lua code blocks (APPROPRIATE) | Keep - this is a code standard guide |
| `docs/testing/framework.md` | Code blocks (APPROPRIATE) | Keep - this is a technical framework doc |

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Extract code from `TILESET_SYSTEM.md` ‚Üí Create `docs/technical/TILESET_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- [ ] Extract code from `FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md` ‚Üí Create `docs/technical/FIRE_SMOKE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- [ ] Extract code from `RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` ‚Üí Create `docs/technical/RESOLUTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- [ ] Replace code with descriptions: "This system uses a coordinate system with values ranging from..."

### 2. üîÑ Duplicate/Overlapping Folder Purposes

**Problem:** Multiple folders cover similar concepts with unclear relationship.

#### Pair 1: `balance/` vs `balancing/`
```
docs/balance/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GAME_NUMBERS.md (276 lines)
    
docs/balancing/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ framework.md (148 lines)
```
**Issue:** Both cover balance concepts
- `balance/GAME_NUMBERS.md` = Game balance numeric data
- `balancing/framework.md` = Balance testing framework

**Recommendation:** CONSOLIDATE
- [ ] Keep: `docs/balance/` (game balance focus)
- [ ] Rename: `balancing/` ‚Üí `balance/testing/` (move framework.md there)
- [ ] Result: `docs/balance/GAME_NUMBERS.md` + `docs/balance/testing/framework.md`

#### Pair 2: `economy/` structure duplication
```
docs/economy/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/              ‚Üê Subfolder exists!
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manufacturing.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/            ‚Üê Subfolder exists!
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ marketplace.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ marketplace/           ‚Üê Subfolder exists!
```
**Issue:** Files and folders with same names at different levels

**Current Status:**
- `docs/economy/research.md` (216 lines) 
- `docs/economy/research/` (folder, appears empty based on structure)
- `docs/economy/production/` (folder exists)
- `docs/economy/manufacturing.md` (264 lines)
- `docs/economy/marketplace.md` (140 lines)
- `docs/economy/marketplace/` (folder exists)
- `docs/economy/finance/` (folder exists - unclear purpose)

**Recommendation:** CLARIFY & REORGANIZE
- [ ] `docs/economy/research.md` = Keep as main design doc
  - `docs/economy/research/` = Remove if empty, or clarify subfolder purpose
- [ ] `docs/economy/manufacturing.md` = Keep as main design doc
  - `docs/economy/production/` = Rename to subdocs if needed
- [ ] `docs/economy/marketplace.md` = Keep as main design doc
  - `docs/economy/marketplace/` = Clarify or remove
- [ ] `docs/economy/finance/` = UNCLEAR - Rename to `docs/economy/funding/` or merge with funding.md
- [ ] Create `docs/economy/README.md` explaining the subfolder structure

#### Pair 3: `content/` structure fragmentation
```
docs/content/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ items.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crafts/              ‚Üê Subfolder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ equipment/           ‚Üê Subfolder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facilities/          ‚Üê Subfolder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ units/               ‚Üê Subfolder

Engine mirrors this:
engine/content/             ‚Üê Empty?
engine/battlescape/units/   ‚Üê Where content actually lives?
engine/basescape/           ‚Üê Where facilities live?
```
**Recommendation:** CLARIFY STRUCTURE
- [ ] Decide: Is `docs/content/` the right folder for these, or should they be:
  - `docs/battlescape/content/units/`?
  - `docs/basescape/content/facilities/`?
  - `docs/economy/content/manufacturing/`?
- [ ] Create master `docs/content/README.md` explaining organization
- [ ] Update engine/ structure to match docs/ organization

---

### 3. üìç Navigation Files with Redundant Content

**Problem:** 4 main navigation/overview files with overlapping purposes.

| File | Lines | Purpose | Overlap Issue |
|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| `README.md` | 80 lines | Folder intro, structure, document standards | Explains PURPOSE of docs/ |
| `OVERVIEW.md` | 186 lines | Game design overview, flow diagrams | Explains GAME DESIGN high-level |
| `QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` | 355 lines | Index of all docs, links, statistics | Explains WHERE TO FIND THINGS |
| `API.md` | 1,811 lines | Complete API reference | Technical developer reference |

**Current Redundancy:**
- `README.md` + `OVERVIEW.md` both start with "purpose" statements
- `QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` duplicates links from `README.md` folder structure
- `API.md` separate from design docs (unclear relationship)
- New users unclear which to read first

**Recommendation:** STREAMLINE
- [ ] **Keep:** `README.md` (What this folder is)
- [ ] **Keep:** `OVERVIEW.md` (Game design overview)
- [ ] **MERGE:** `QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` ‚Üí Move useful sections to `README.md`, keep as extended index
- [ ] **Clarify:** `API.md` - Should this be in `docs/` or `wiki/`? (Currently unclear)

**New Navigation Flow:**
1. Start: `docs/README.md` (What is this folder?)
2. Explore: `docs/OVERVIEW.md` (What is this game?)
3. Find: `docs/QUICK_NAVIGATION.md` (Where is [X]?)
4. Reference: `docs/API.md` (Technical API)

---

### 4. üóÇÔ∏è Unclear Folder Purposes

Several folders lack clear purpose or structure:

| Folder | Status | Issue | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| `docs/ai/` | 4 subfolders | No README explaining structure | Add README explaining diplomacy/pathfinding/strategic/tactical organization |
| `docs/geoscape/` | Many subfolders | 10+ folders, unclear hierarchy | Create master organization diagram in README |
| `docs/battlescape/` | Many subfolders | 10+ files and folders mixed | Separate "design" docs from "technical" docs |
| `docs/systems/` | 3 large technical files | More technical than design | Should these be in `docs/technical/` instead? |
| `docs/rendering/` | 1 file | Single file folder | Consider moving to `docs/technical/` |
| `docs/design/` | 1 file | Single file folder | Consider moving to `docs/references/` |
| `docs/analytics/` | Empty folder? | No files visible | Remove or populate with design |
| `docs/scenes/` | Empty folder? | No files visible | Remove or populate with design |
| `docs/tutorial/` | Empty folder? | No files visible | Remove or populate with design |
| `docs/widgets/` | Empty folder? | No files visible | Remove or populate with design |
| `docs/network/` | 1 file (multiplayer.md) | Minimal content | OK for future expansion |

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add README to all folders with purpose and subfolder structure
- [ ] Create `docs/technical/` folder for implementation-focused technical docs
- [ ] Move technical analysis docs: `systems/`, `rendering/` to `docs/technical/`
- [ ] Consolidate empty folders or remove them
- [ ] Create organization diagrams showing folder hierarchy

---

### 5. üìÑ Files Needing Consolidation or Splitting

#### A. Files That Should Be Split

| File | Size | Recommendation |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `docs/battlescape/COMBAT_SYSTEMS_COMPLETE.md` | Large? | Split into: combat-basics.md, combat-advanced.md, combat-ai.md |
| `docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Large? | Too implementation-focused; move to `docs/technical/` |
| `docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md` | 825 lines | MAJOR: Split into design + technical implementation docs |
| `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` | 656 lines | Split into design + technical analysis |

#### B. Files That Should Be Consolidated

| Files | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------------|
| `docs/core/LUA_BEST_PRACTICES.md` + `docs/core/LUA_DOCSTRING_GUIDE.md` | Keep separate - they serve different purposes |
| `docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_*.md` (3 files) | These may overlap - audit for duplication |
| `docs/battlescape/3D_BATTLESCAPE_*.md` (2 files) | Review for consolidation |

---

### 6. üèóÔ∏è Naming Inconsistencies

**Problem:** File naming conventions are inconsistent.

```
‚úÖ Good naming (consistent):
- docs/economy/research.md (lowercase, specific)
- docs/economy/manufacturing.md (lowercase, specific)
- docs/economy/marketplace.md (lowercase, specific)

‚ùå Bad naming (inconsistent):
- docs/OVERVIEW.md (CAPS)
- docs/QUICK_NAVIGATION.md (CAPS + underscores)
- docs/battlescape/COMBAT_SYSTEMS_COMPLETE.md (CAPS + descriptive)
- docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md (CAPS + UNDERSCORES)
- docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md (CAPS + descriptive)
- docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md (CAPS)
- docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_DIAGRAMS.md (CAPS + descriptive)
- docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (CAPS + descriptive)
- docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (CAPS + descriptive)
```

**Recommendation:** STANDARDIZE
- [ ] Root-level index files: Keep UPPERCASE (README.md, OVERVIEW.md, QUICK_NAVIGATION.md, API.md)
- [ ] Design doc files: Use lowercase (missions.md, combat.md, units.md, etc.)
- [ ] Technical/system analysis: Use UPPERCASE (SYSTEM_NAME.md) with clear purpose
- [ ] OR: Create subfolder `docs/analysis/` for large analysis/reference files

**Suggested Renames:**
```
docs/battlescape/COMBAT_SYSTEMS_COMPLETE.md 
  ‚Üí docs/technical/COMBAT_SYSTEMS_COMPLETE.md
  
docs/battlescape/3D_BATTLESCAPE_ARCHITECTURE.md
  ‚Üí docs/technical/3D_BATTLESCAPE_ARCHITECTURE.md
  
docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md
  ‚Üí docs/technical/TILESET_SYSTEM.md
  
docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md
  ‚Üí docs/technical/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md
  
docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md
  ‚Üí docs/technical/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md
  
docs/geoscape/STRATEGIC_LAYER_*.md (3 files)
  ‚Üí docs/technical/GEOSCAPE_STRATEGIC_LAYER_*.md
```

---

### 7. üìö Missing Documentation

Folders that exist in `docs/` but have no or minimal content:

```
‚ùå Empty or near-empty:
- docs/analytics/ (empty?)
- docs/scenes/ (empty?)
- docs/tutorial/ (empty?)
- docs/utils/ (empty?)
- docs/widgets/ (empty?)
- docs/politics/ (has subfolders but no README?)
- docs/progression/ (only organization.md)
- docs/localization/ (empty?)

‚ö†Ô∏è Single file folders:
- docs/design/ (1 file: REFERENCES.md)
- docs/rendering/ (1 file: HEX_RENDERING_GUIDE.md)
- docs/network/ (1 file: multiplayer.md)
- docs/lore/ (1 file: narrative.md)
```

**Recommendation:**
- [ ] Either populate these folders with design docs OR remove them
- [ ] Add README to all non-empty folders
- [ ] Create placeholder README for future-expansion folders

---

### 8. üîó Cross-Linking Issues

**Problem:** Relative paths in cross-references may be broken or unclear.

**Current Pattern:** Files use `../../../engine/path/` which works but is fragile.

**Better Approach:**
- [ ] Use consistent path format in all files
- [ ] Consider creating `docs/cross-reference-map.md` documenting all links
- [ ] Validate all cross-references with automated script

---

## APPENDIX A: Files That Need Code Removal

### docs/systems/TILESET_SYSTEM.md
- **Current:** 825 lines with 12 TOML + 7 Lua blocks
- **Action:** Create design version + TILESET_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Scope:** Large refactoring needed

### docs/systems/FIRE_SMOKE_MECHANICS.md

## APPENDIX C: Folder Purpose Clarifications Needed

| Folder | Current | Needs Clarification |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `docs/content/` | items.md + subfolders | Should items be content/items/ or content/equipment/? |
| `docs/geoscape/` | 10+ files/folders | How do 9 subfolders relate? What are data/ geography/ rendering/ subfolders for? |
| `docs/battlescape/` | 10+ files/folders | Clear organization, but files like COMBAT_SYSTEMS_COMPLETE are too large |
| `docs/ai/` | 4 subfolders | README needed explaining diplomacy/pathfinding/strategic/tactical separation |
| `docs/politics/` | 5 subfolders | README needed explaining folder structure |
| `docs/economy/` | Files + duplicate subfolders | MAJOR confusion with research/ production/ marketplace/ finance/ |
