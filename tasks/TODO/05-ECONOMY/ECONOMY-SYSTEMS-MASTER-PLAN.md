## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) - 204 hours
**Core Systems:**
1. **Research System** (96h) - Tech tree, projects, progression
2. **Manufacturing System** (108h) - Production, workshops, resources

**Why First:**
- Foundation for all other economy systems
- Research unlocks manufacturing
- Manufacturing enables self-sufficiency
- Both integrate with calendar/facilities

---

### Phase 2: Commerce (Weeks 5-9) - 192 hours
**Trading Systems:**
3. **Marketplace & Suppliers** (120h) - Normal trade, suppliers, relationships
4. **Black Market** (72h) - Illegal trade, karma/fame impact

**Why Second:**
- Depends on research (unlocks)
- Depends on manufacturing (competition/comparison)
- Marketplace before black market (normal â†’ illegal)

---

### Phase 3: Meta-Progression (Weeks 10-12) - 94 hours
**Integrated Systems:**
5. **Fame/Karma/Reputation** (94h) - Affects all economy systems

**Why Last:**
- Integrates with ALL previous systems
- Affects pricing, availability, access
- Ties everything together
- Polish and balance pass

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Research vs Manufacturing
```
Research (Global):
- Shared across all bases
- All scientists contribute
- Unlocks capabilities
- Knowledge is shared

Manufacturing (Local):
- Per-base only
- Each base has own queue
- Consumes resources
- Physical production
```

### Pricing Strategy
```
Normal Marketplace:
- Relationship: -50% to +100%
- Bulk: -5% to -30%
- Reputation: -20% to +30%
- Fame: -10% to +10%
- Total range: ~40% to ~140% of base

Black Market:
- Base: 133% (33% markup)
- Same modifiers as normal
- Total range: ~53% to ~186% of normal base
```

### Karma System
```
High Karma (+75 to +100):
- Unlocks humanitarian missions
- Better recruit morale
- Ethical suppliers prefer
- Black market LOCKED

Low Karma (-75 to -100):
- Unlocks black ops missions
- Black market ACCESS
- Some suppliers refuse
- Public backlash risk
```

### Key Interactions
- Research unlocks â†’ Manufacturing options
- Manufacturing costs â†’ Marketplace alternatives
- Marketplace prices â†’ Black market appeal
- Karma choices â†’ Black market access
- Fame level â†’ All price modifiers

### Balance Considerations
- Research should feel meaningful (impactful unlocks)
- Manufacturing should be cheaper than buying (incentive)
- Marketplace should be convenient (immediate)
- Black Market should be risky but rewarding
- Fame/Karma should create meaningful choices
