# Task: Implement Game System Designs

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** 2025-01-XX  
**Completed:** N/A  
**Assigned To:** AI Agent

---

## Overview

Implement core game systems documented in wiki/wiki/design.md: faction system, organizational progression, automation systems, and difficulty scaling. These systems are fundamental to AlienFall's gameplay loop and strategic depth.

---

## Purpose

The design.md document outlines critical game systems that define AlienFall's progression and replayability. These systems need implementation and proper documentation to complete the game's strategic layer and provide players with meaningful progression paths.

- `mods/core/difficulty/scaling_rules.toml` (create)

**Estimated time:** 5 hours

### Step 5: Create Comprehensive Documentation
**Description:** Document all systems with examples, configuration guides, and gameplay impact  
**Files to create:**
- `docs/progression/faction_system.md`
- `docs/progression/organizational_progression.md`
- `docs/core/automation_systems.md`
- `docs/core/difficulty_scaling.md`
- `docs/modding/faction_creation.md`

**Estimated time:** 4 hours

### Step 6: Testing
**Description:** Unit tests for system logic, integration tests for gameplay flow  
**Test cases:**
- Faction progression triggers correct events
- Organization level upgrades apply bonuses
- Automation executes tasks correctly
- Difficulty scaling affects enemy stats appropriately
- Save/load preserves system state

**Files to create:**
- `tests/geoscape/test_faction_system.lua`
- `tests/geoscape/test_organization.lua`
- `tests/unit/test_automation_system.lua`
- `tests/unit/test_difficulty_manager.lua`

**Estimated time:** 4 hours

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
**Faction System**:
- Faction data stored in mods/core/factions/*.toml
- FactionManager tracks active factions and research progress
- Research completion triggers lore events and new mission types
- Failed research leads to escalating difficulty (tower defense mechanics)

**Organizational Progression**:
- 4-5 progression levels (Company → Corporation → Military Org)
- Each level unlocks: +capacity, +income, +base slots, +craft slots
- Progression via reputation points, funding milestones, research

**Automation System**:
- Rule-based automation with configurable priorities
- Base automation: facility construction, personnel assignment
- Manufacturing automation: queue management, resource allocation
- Combat automation: simple tactical AI for non-player battles

**Difficulty Scaling**:
- Preset difficulty levels with custom modifiers
- Dynamic scaling based on player performance
- Affects: enemy stats, resource availability, mission frequency, AI behavior

### Key Components
- **FactionSystem**: Manages faction states, research, and lore
- **ProgressionManager**: Handles organization level advancement
- **AutomationSystem**: Executes automated tasks per game turn
- **DifficultyManager**: Applies difficulty modifiers to game systems

### Dependencies
- engine/geoscape/campaign_manager.lua
- engine/economy/ for funding calculations
- engine/ai/ for AI behavior modification
- mods/core/ TOML files for configuration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test 1: Faction research progression logic
- Test 2: Organization level bonus calculations
- Test 3: Automation rule evaluation and execution
- Test 4: Difficulty modifier application to enemy stats

### Integration Tests
- Test 1: Complete faction research arc and verify events
- Test 2: Progress through all organization levels
- Test 3: Enable automation and verify task execution over time
- Test 4: Switch difficulty levels and verify gameplay changes

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Run game with `lovec "engine"`
2. Start new campaign on different difficulty levels
3. Complete faction research and verify lore unlocks
4. Progress organization levels and verify bonuses
5. Enable automation for base management
6. Verify automation builds facilities and assigns personnel
7. Check difficulty scaling affects enemy encounters
8. Verify all systems work together (faction + progression + difficulty)

### Expected Results
- Faction research unlocks new content and missions
- Organization levels provide meaningful progression
- Automation reduces micromanagement without losing player control
- Difficulty scaling creates appropriate challenge
- All systems integrate smoothly with existing gameplay

## How to Run/Debug

### Running the Game
```bash
lovec "engine"
```
or use the VS Code task: "Run XCOM Simple Game"

### Debugging
- Love2D console is enabled in `conf.lua` (t.console = true)
- Use `print("[FactionSystem] ...")` for faction debugging
- Use `print("[OrgProgression] ...")` for organization debugging
- Use `print("[Automation] ...")` for automation debugging
- Use `print("[Difficulty] ...")` for difficulty debugging
- Add system state dumps: `print("[System] State: " .. tostring(state))`
- Monitor automation execution in console

### Temporary Files
- Automation logs: `os.getenv("TEMP") .. "\\alienfall\\automation.log"`
- Faction state cache: `os.getenv("TEMP") .. "\\alienfall\\factions.cache"`

## Documentation Updates

### Files to Update
- [x] `docs/progression/faction_system.md` - Create faction system guide
- [x] `docs/progression/organizational_progression.md` - Create progression guide
- [x] `docs/core/automation_systems.md` - Create automation guide
- [x] `docs/core/difficulty_scaling.md` - Create difficulty guide
- [x] `docs/modding/faction_creation.md` - TOML faction creation guide
- [ ] `wiki/API.md` - Add FactionSystem, ProgressionManager, AutomationSystem, DifficultyManager APIs
- [ ] `wiki/FAQ.md` - Add "How does progression work?" entry
- [ ] Code comments - Document all system logic

---

## Notes

- Faction system ties into campaign structure and lore delivery
- Organization progression provides long-term goals and scaling
- Automation is optional - must not be required for gameplay
- Difficulty scaling should feel fair, not artificially limiting
- All systems should be moddable for community customization
