## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Design documents incomplete or ambiguous
**Mitigation:** When design is unclear, document as "To Be Designed" and flag for design team review

### Risk 2: API changes conflict with engine implementation
**Mitigation:** Verify engine code during documentation; flag conflicts for engine team

### Risk 3: Scope creep (discovering more gaps during work)
**Mitigation:** Document new gaps but don't expand scope; schedule for next iteration

### Risk 4: Time estimation inaccurate
**Mitigation:** Focus on high-priority items first; low-priority can slip to Phase 6 if needed

## Notes

- This task is **documentation-only** - no code changes to engine/
- All changes are in api/ and potentially design/gaps/ (to track progress)
- Use temp/ for analysis artifacts and working documents
- Update SYNCHRONIZATION_GUIDE.md with lessons learned
- Consider automation to prevent future gaps

## Progress Tracking

### Phase Completion
- [ ] Phase 1: High Priority Gaps (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Phase 2: Medium Priority Gaps (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Phase 3: Low Priority Gaps (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration (Week 7)
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation (Week 8)

### Gap Resolution Count
- High Priority: 0/12 resolved
- Medium Priority: 0/24 resolved
- Low Priority: 0/18 resolved
- **Total: 0/54 resolved**

### Alignment Progress
- Starting: 87.5%
- Current: 87.5%
- Target: 95%
