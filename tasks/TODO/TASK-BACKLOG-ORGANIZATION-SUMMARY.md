## Key Findings

### Task Distribution

| Category | Tasks | Hours | % of Total | Priority Mix |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Battlescape | 10 | ~510h | 46% | 3 High, 6 Med, 1 Low |
| Geoscape | 7 | ~285h | 26% | 3 Critical, 2 High, 2 Med |
| Basescape | 4 | ~165h | 15% | 2 High, 2 Med |
| Economy | 3 | ~125h | 11% | 1 Med, 2 Low |
| Interception | 1 | ~30h | 3% | 1 Med |
| **TOTAL** | **25** | **~1,115h** | **100%** | - |

### Critical Path (Minimum Viable Game)

**6 tasks, ~385 hours (6-7 weeks):**
1. Geoscape Core (80h)
2. Map Generation (60h)
3. Mission Detection Loop (45h)
4. Base Facilities (50h)
5. Battle Objectives (40h)
6. Mission Salvage (35h)

**Result:** Playable game with complete mission loop

### High-Value Features (Maximum Impact)

**4 additional tasks, ~265 hours (4-5 weeks):**
7. 3D Battlescape (270h total for all 3 phases)
8. Research System (40h)
9. Manufacturing System (40h)
10. Marketplace System (50h)

**Total with high-value:** ~650 hours (10-11 weeks)

### Parallel Development Potential

With a team of 5 developers, timeline can be reduced from **16-17 weeks to 5-6 weeks** due to:
- 3D Battlescape can start after Week 1 (independent track)
- Combat mechanics have no dependencies (can start anytime)
- Economy systems can start after Week 5
- Multiple developers can work on different game modes simultaneously

## Key Insights

### Dependencies Form Natural Clusters

**Strategic Layer:** Geoscape → Missions → Relations → Lore  
**Tactical Layer:** Map Gen → Objectives → Combat Mechanics  
**Management Layer:** Bases → Research → Manufacturing  
**Economy Layer:** Marketplace → Black Market → Fame/Karma  
**Rendering Layer:** 3D Core → 3D Units → 3D Effects  

### 3 Tiers of Priority

**Tier 1 - Critical Path (6 tasks):** Must have for MVP  
**Tier 2 - High Value (10 tasks):** Maximum impact features  
**Tier 3 - Polish & Depth (9 tasks):** Nice to have, can defer  

### Parallel Development is Key

Single-threaded development: **16-17 weeks**  
With 3 parallel tracks: **8-10 weeks**  
With 5 parallel tracks: **5-6 weeks**  

**Bottleneck:** Geoscape must be done first (everything depends on it)

### Risk Mitigation Built-In

**High-risk tasks identified:**
- Geoscape Core (complex, many dependencies)
- 3D Battlescape (rendering complexity)
- Map Generation (procedural bugs)

**Mitigations planned:**
- Start high-risk tasks early
- Build in layers with testing
- Use proven libraries (g3d)
- Prototype before full implementation

---

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### After Each Phase
- Playtest complete gameplay loop
- Check performance (Love2D console)
- Verify integration with existing systems
- Update documentation (API.md, FAQ.md)
- Refactor and optimize

### Milestone Validation
- **Phase 1:** Can play complete mission
- **Phase 2:** Base building works
- **Phase 3:** Missions feel varied
- **Phase 4:** 3D mode is fun
- **Phase 5:** Combat has depth
- **Phase 6:** Economy feels balanced
- **Phase 7:** Strategic layer engaging
- **Phase 8:** Feature complete
