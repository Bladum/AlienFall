A: 107 hours total. 5-8 weeks with 1 developer, 2-3 weeks with 2-3 developers.

**Q: Can I do this in parallel?**
A: Yes! Phases 1-4 and 5-7 can run in parallel if you have 2+ developers.

**Q: What if I find bugs in my tests?**
A: That's the point! Property tests especially will find edge cases.

**Q: Do I need to modify existing tests?**
A: No! All 2,493 existing tests remain unchanged and continue to work.

**Q: What if a test fails?**
A: Check console output (Love2D console enabled). Reference the spec for that phase.
