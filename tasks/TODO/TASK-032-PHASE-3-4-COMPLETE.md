## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Map Block Loader
```lua
-- Load all blocks from directory
MapBlockLoader.loadAll("mods/core/mapblocks")

-- Filter by group
local urbanBlocks = MapBlockLoader.getByGroup(1)

-- Filter by tags
local ufoBlocks = MapBlockLoader.getByTags({"ufo", "alien"})

-- Filter by size
local largeBlocks = MapBlockLoader.getBySize(30, 30)
```

### Map Script Executor
```lua
-- Load script
local script = MapScriptsV2.get("urban_patrol")

-- Execute with seed
local context = MapScriptExecutor.execute(script, 12345)

-- Get results
local stats = MapScriptExecutor.getStats(context)
print(string.format("Map is %.1f%% filled", stats.fillPercentage))
```

### Command Example (addBlock)
```toml
[[commands]]
type = "addBlock"
groups = [1, 2]      # Urban and farmland groups
freqs = [15, 5]      # 75% urban, 25% farmland
size = [1, 1]        # 15×15 blocks
amount = 10          # Place 10 blocks
chance = 100         # Always execute
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

1. **v2 Naming:** Used `mapblock_loader_v2.lua` and `mapscripts_v2.lua` to avoid conflicts with existing systems during development.

2. **Modular Commands:** Each command in separate file allows:
   - Easy testing of individual commands
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Lazy loading (only load commands used by script)
   - Simple addition of new commands

3. **TOML Format:** Human-readable and writable without IDE. Modders can edit with any text editor.

4. **Group System (0-99):** Simple numeric groups easier to remember and faster to filter than complex tag systems.

5. **Weighted Selection:** Frequency-based weighting provides variety without complex probability systems.

6. **Context Object:** Central state object passed to all commands simplifies API and allows commands to share data.

7. **Rect Constraints:** Bounding boxes for block placement enable precise control over layout (e.g., "place UFO in center quadrant").

8. **Usage Tracking:** Block usage counts enable conditional logic ("if we've used more than 5 of X, do Y").

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Lint Warnings:** Some commands add fields to context dynamically (craftSpawn, ufoObjective) which triggers lint warnings. Harmless.

2. **Asset Linking:** PNG assets not yet created/linked to Map Tiles. Using placeholder paths.

3. **Hex Grid:** Commands assume square grid. Phase 6 will adapt for hex coordinates.

4. **No Autotile Yet:** Autotile logic exists but no example Map Tiles use it yet.

## 🏆 What Worked Well

1. **Incremental Approach:** Building systems in order (Tilesets → Blocks → Scripts) allowed each layer to build on previous.

2. **TOML Early:** Defining TOML format upfront made implementation straightforward.

3. **Small Commands:** Breaking commands into 50-150 line modules kept complexity manageable.

4. **Test-Driven:** Creating test files alongside implementation caught issues early.

5. **Documentation First:** Having MAP_SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md before implementation clarified requirements.

6. **Example Content:** Creating real Map Blocks and Scripts validated system design.

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Context Flexibility:** Dynamic fields on context useful but trigger lint warnings. Document this pattern.

2. **Command Complexity:** Some commands (addCraft, addUFO) require special logic. Consider extracting shared placement logic.

3. **Rect Math:** Converting between blocks and tiles requires care. Consider utility functions.

4. **RNG Seeding:** Seeded RNG crucial for reproducibility. Always log seed value.

5. **Tag Parsing:** Simple comma-separated tags work well. More complex queries can come later.
