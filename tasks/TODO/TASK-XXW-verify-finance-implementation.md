# Task: Verify Finance System Implementation

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** October 15, 2025  
**Completed:** N/A  
**Assigned To:** AI Agent / Developer

---

## Overview

Verify whether the Finance System is fully implemented in `engine/economy/finance/` and determine next steps. The system has documentation in `docs/economy/funding.md` but the implementation folder only contains a README.md file, suggesting it may be incomplete.

---

## Purpose

**Situation:**
- Documentation exists: `docs/economy/funding.md` covers finance topics
- Design notes exist: `wiki/wiki/finance.md` (91 lines)
- Implementation unclear: `engine/economy/finance/` has only README.md

**This task determines:**
1. Is the finance system fully implemented elsewhere?
2. Is it partially implemented and needs completion?
3. Is it not implemented and needs to be built?
4. Can `wiki/wiki/finance.md` be removed or does it need preservation?

---

## Requirements

### Investigation Requirements
- [ ] Check `engine/economy/finance/` contents thoroughly
- [ ] Search for finance implementation in other economy folders
- [ ] Read `docs/economy/funding.md` to understand documented features
- [ ] Read `wiki/wiki/finance.md` to understand design intentions
- [ ] Compare documentation vs. implementation to find gaps

### Decision Requirements
- [ ] Determine implementation status: None / Partial / Complete
- [ ] If partial: Identify what's missing
- [ ] If complete: Verify location and functionality
- [ ] Decide fate of `wiki/wiki/finance.md`: Remove or Keep

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implementation status determined with confidence
- [ ] If incomplete: Task created to implement missing features
- [ ] If complete: Documentation verified and wiki file removed
- [ ] Clear recommendation provided

---

## Plan

### Step 1: Check Finance Implementation
**Description:** Thoroughly investigate the finance system implementation  
**Actions:**
- List all files in `engine/economy/finance/`
- Search for "finance" across entire economy folder
- Search for "funding" across entire economy folder
- Check if finance logic is in main economy files
- Review `engine/economy/README.md` if it exists

**Commands:**
```bash
ls -la engine/economy/finance/
grep -r "finance" engine/economy/
grep -r "funding" engine/economy/
grep -r "income\|expense\|budget" engine/economy/
```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

### Step 2: Review Documentation
**Description:** Understand what's documented vs. designed  
**Files to read:**
- `docs/economy/funding.md` - What's officially documented
- `wiki/wiki/finance.md` - What's designed (91 lines)
- `engine/economy/README.md` - Implementation status (if exists)

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

### Step 3: Compare and Analyze
**Description:** Compare documentation with implementation  
**Questions to answer:**
- Are all documented features implemented?
- Are all designed features implemented?
- Is finance handled by another system?
- Are there gaps or missing features?

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes

### Step 4: Make Recommendation
**Description:** Determine next steps based on findings  

**Possible outcomes:**
1. **Fully Implemented:** Finance is complete, just in unexpected location
   - Action: Document location, remove wiki/wiki/finance.md
   
2. **Partially Implemented:** Some features exist, some missing
   - Action: Create implementation task for missing features, keep wiki file until complete
   
3. **Not Implemented:** No finance system exists
   - Action: Create full implementation task, keep wiki file for reference
   
4. **Handled Elsewhere:** Finance is part of economy/funding system
   - Action: Update docs to clarify, remove wiki file

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes

### Step 5: Take Action
**Description:** Execute the recommended next steps  
**Possible actions:**
- Create implementation task (if needed)
- Remove wiki/wiki/finance.md (if system is complete)
- Update documentation (if clarification needed)
- Update this task status to DONE

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes (if simple) to 1 hour (if creating new task)

## Implementation Details

### Investigation Focus
Check these locations for finance implementation:
- `engine/economy/finance/` - Expected location
- `engine/economy/` - May be in main economy files
- `engine/basescape/` - Financial management may be in base management
- `engine/geoscape/` - Monthly funding may be in geoscape
- `engine/politics/` - Funding may be tied to political relations

### Key Finance Features (from wiki/wiki/finance.md)
Topics that should be implemented:
- Funding sources (countries, organizations)
- Monthly income calculation
- Expense tracking (salaries, maintenance, construction)
- Budget management
- Financial reports and projections
- Bankruptcy/game over conditions
- Economic events and bonuses

### Dependencies
- Economy system (for transactions)
- Geoscape system (for monthly cycles)
- Political system (for country relationships)
- Basescape system (for expenses)

---

## Testing Strategy

This is an **investigation task**, not an implementation task.

### Verification Steps
1. List all files in finance folder
2. Search codebase for finance-related terms
3. Read relevant documentation
4. Compare documented vs. implemented features
5. Make informed decision on status

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear understanding of implementation status
- [ ] Gaps identified (if any)
- [ ] Next steps determined
- [ ] Action taken (task created, wiki removed, or docs updated)

---

## How to Run/Debug

### Investigation Commands
```bash
# Check finance folder contents
ls -la engine/economy/finance/
cat engine/economy/finance/README.md

# Search for finance implementation
grep -r "finance\|funding\|budget\|income\|expense" engine/economy/ -l
grep -r "monthly.*income\|monthly.*expense" engine/ -l

# Check if handled in other systems
grep -r "finance" engine/geoscape/ -l
grep -r "funding" engine/politics/ -l
```

### Reading Documentation
```bash
# Open relevant docs
code docs/economy/funding.md
code wiki/wiki/finance.md
code engine/economy/README.md  # if exists
```

---

## Documentation Updates

### If Finance is Complete
- [ ] No docs needed - already documented in `docs/economy/funding.md`
- [ ] Remove `wiki/wiki/finance.md`

### If Finance is Incomplete
- [ ] Keep `wiki/wiki/finance.md` for reference
- [ ] Create implementation task with details from analysis
- [ ] Note gaps in implementation task

### If Finance is Elsewhere
- [ ] Update `docs/economy/funding.md` to clarify location
- [ ] Remove `wiki/wiki/finance.md`
- [ ] Add cross-references to actual implementation

---

## Notes

**Context:**
- `docs/economy/funding.md` exists and covers finance topics
- `wiki/wiki/finance.md` has 91 lines of design notes
- `engine/economy/finance/` folder exists but appears minimal

**Key Questions:**
1. Is finance fully implemented in `engine/economy/finance/`?
2. Is finance implemented elsewhere (e.g., in main economy system)?
3. Is finance partially implemented with some features missing?
4. Is finance not implemented at all?

**Expected Outcome:**
Based on similar patterns in the codebase, finance is likely:
- **Option A:** Implemented in `engine/economy/` main files (not separate finance/ folder)
- **Option B:** Partially implemented with basic funding but missing advanced features
- **Option C:** Planned but not yet implemented

**Finance System Features (from wiki/wiki/finance.md):**
- Funding sources
- Income/expense tracking  
- Monthly budget cycles
- Financial reports
- Bankruptcy conditions
- Economic events

**Decision Tree:**
```
Check engine/economy/finance/
├─ Has implementation files?
│  ├─ YES → Verify completeness → Remove wiki file or create completion task
│  └─ NO → Check engine/economy/ main files
│     ├─ Finance code found? → Document location, remove wiki file
│     └─ No finance code? → Create implementation task, keep wiki file
```
