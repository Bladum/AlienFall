# Task: Migrate Roadmap to Tasks System

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** Low  
**Created:** 2025-01-XX  
**Completed:** N/A  
**Assigned To:** AI Agent

---

## Overview

Migrate content from wiki/wiki/roadmap.md into the tasks/tasks.md system, then remove roadmap.md from wiki. The roadmap contains high-level project planning that belongs in the task tracking system.

---

## Purpose

Consolidate project planning into a single location (tasks/tasks.md) to avoid duplication and confusion. The roadmap.md file contains phase overviews, task dependencies, success criteria, and risk mitigation that should be integrated into the formal task tracking system.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Extract all actionable content from roadmap.md
- [ ] Convert roadmap phases into task categories or milestones
- [ ] Migrate task dependencies to tasks/tasks.md
- [ ] Document success criteria and risk mitigation in appropriate sections
- [ ] Remove roadmap.md after successful migration

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Update tasks/tasks.md with roadmap content
- [ ] Maintain existing task structure and formatting
- [ ] Ensure no information loss during migration
- [ ] Update any references to roadmap.md in other files

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All roadmap content integrated into tasks/tasks.md
- [ ] Phase overview becomes milestone section
- [ ] Task dependencies documented
- [ ] Success criteria and risk mitigation preserved
- [ ] roadmap.md removed from wiki/wiki/
- [ ] No broken links to roadmap.md

---

## Plan

### Step 1: Analyze roadmap.md Content
**Description:** Review roadmap.md to identify all content sections and their purpose  
**Files to analyze:**
- `wiki/wiki/roadmap.md`

**Content to extract:**
- Phase overview (Foundations, migration, UI, testing)
- Task dependencies (Service-first approach, adapters)
- Success criteria (Determinism, reproducibility)
- Risk mitigation (Incremental changes, testing gates)
- Timeline milestones (Gantt-style phases)

**Estimated time:** 0.5 hours

### Step 2: Update tasks/tasks.md with Roadmap Content
**Description:** Integrate roadmap content into tasks/tasks.md structure  
**Files to modify:**
- `tasks/tasks.md`

**Integration approach:**
- Add "Project Milestones" section at top of tasks.md
- Convert phases to milestone categories
- Add "Task Dependencies" section documenting critical paths
- Add "Success Criteria" section for project standards
- Add "Risk Mitigation" section for project management

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

### Step 3: Verify No Information Loss
**Description:** Compare original roadmap.md with integrated content to ensure completeness  
**Verification steps:**
- Check all sections migrated
- Verify all dependencies documented
- Confirm success criteria preserved
- Ensure risk mitigation strategies captured

**Estimated time:** 0.5 hours

### Step 4: Search for References to roadmap.md
**Description:** Find and update any files that reference roadmap.md  
**Files to check:**
- `wiki/wiki/plan.md`
- `wiki/wiki/toc.md`
- `docs/` files
- `wiki/` files
- `README.md` files

**Update approach:**
- Replace references to roadmap.md with tasks/tasks.md
- Remove roadmap.md from table of contents
- Update navigation links

**Estimated time:** 0.5 hours

### Step 5: Remove roadmap.md
**Description:** Delete roadmap.md from wiki/wiki/ after successful migration  
**Files to remove:**
- `wiki/wiki/roadmap.md`

**Command:**
```powershell
Remove-Item "wiki\wiki\roadmap.md"
```

**Estimated time:** 0.25 hours

### Step 6: Documentation Update
**Description:** Update relevant documentation to reflect roadmap migration  
**Files to update:**
- `tasks/tasks.md` (add note about roadmap integration)
- `WIKI_PHASE_5_DEEP_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` (mark roadmap as migrated)

**Estimated time:** 0.25 hours

---

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
**Migration Strategy**:
- Extract structured content from roadmap.md
- Map roadmap sections to task system sections
- Preserve all project planning information
- Remove duplicate file after migration

**Content Mapping**:
- Phase Overview → Project Milestones section
- Task Dependencies → Dependencies documentation
- Success Criteria → Project Standards
- Risk Mitigation → Risk Management section
- Timeline Milestones → Milestone tracking

### Key Components
- **tasks/tasks.md Enhancement**: Add roadmap content to existing structure
- **Link Updates**: Update references across documentation
- **File Removal**: Clean up wiki/wiki/

### Dependencies
- tasks/tasks.md file structure
- wiki/wiki/roadmap.md content
- Documentation files that may reference roadmap

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Read roadmap.md completely
2. Read updated tasks/tasks.md
3. Verify all roadmap content is present in tasks.md
4. Check for broken links to roadmap.md
5. Verify tasks.md structure is still clear and organized
6. Confirm no information loss

### Expected Results
- tasks/tasks.md contains all roadmap information
- No broken links to roadmap.md
- Project planning consolidated in one location
- roadmap.md removed from wiki

---

## How to Run/Debug

### Migration Process
1. Open roadmap.md in editor
2. Open tasks/tasks.md in split view
3. Copy relevant sections to appropriate locations
4. Format according to tasks.md style
5. Verify completeness
6. Search for references: `grep -r "roadmap.md" .`
7. Remove file: `Remove-Item "wiki\wiki\roadmap.md"`

### Verification
```powershell
# Search for references to roadmap.md
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.md | Select-String "roadmap.md"

# Verify roadmap.md is removed
Test-Path "wiki\wiki\roadmap.md"
```

---

## Documentation Updates

### Files to Update
- [x] `tasks/tasks.md` - Add roadmap content
- [ ] `WIKI_PHASE_5_DEEP_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` - Mark roadmap as migrated
- [ ] Any files with broken links to roadmap.md

---

## Notes

- Roadmap.md is currently a stub with minimal content
- Integration should be straightforward
- Focus on preserving any unique planning information
- Ensure tasks.md remains readable after integration

---

## Blockers

- None identified - simple migration task

---

## Review Checklist

- [ ] All roadmap content migrated to tasks/tasks.md
- [ ] No information loss verified
- [ ] tasks/tasks.md structure maintained
- [ ] All references to roadmap.md updated or removed
- [ ] roadmap.md removed from wiki/wiki/
- [ ] No broken links in documentation
