# Task: Phase 5 Wiki Cleanup

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Priority:** High
**Created:** October 15, 2025
**Completed:** N/A
**Assigned To:** AI Agent

---

## Overview

Reorganize remaining wiki content to focus on developer documentation while removing migrated game design content.

---

## Purpose

Phase 5 completes the documentation migration by cleaning up the wiki folder to contain only developer-focused documentation (API, FAQ, development workflow, technical guides) and removing game design content that has been migrated to the docs/ folder.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Identify all game design content that has been migrated to docs/
- [ ] Remove migrated game design files from wiki/
- [ ] Consolidate technical implementation guides
- [ ] Update wiki navigation and cross-references
- [ ] Ensure wiki contains only developer documentation

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Preserve API.md, FAQ.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- [ ] Keep technical guides (HEX_RENDERING_GUIDE.md, MAP_EDITOR_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- [ ] Remove obsolete wiki summaries (wiki summary 01-08.md)
- [ ] Update any broken cross-references

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wiki folder contains only developer documentation
- [ ] No game design content remains in wiki/
- [ ] All wiki files have updated navigation if needed
- [ ] Cross-references between wiki files are accurate
- [ ] Game still runs successfully after cleanup

## Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Wiki Content
**Description:** Inventory all files in wiki/ and categorize them
**Files to analyze:**
- `wiki/*.md` (root level files)
- `wiki/wiki/*.md` (subfolder files)
- `wiki/internal/*.md`
- `wiki/refences/*.md`

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

### Step 2: Identify Migrated Content
**Description:** Cross-reference wiki files with docs/ content to identify what has been migrated
**Files to check:**
- Compare wiki content against docs/ structure
- Identify duplicate/overlapping content

**Estimated time:** 2 hours

### Step 3: Remove Migrated Game Design Content
**Description:** Delete wiki files that contain game design content now in docs/
**Files to remove:**
- Game design files (battlescape.md, geoscape.md, etc.)
- Implementation summaries that duplicate docs/
- Obsolete wiki summaries

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

### Step 4: Consolidate Technical Guides
**Description:** Organize remaining technical implementation guides
**Files to organize:**
- HEX_RENDERING_GUIDE.md
- MAP_EDITOR_GUIDE.md
- Other technical guides

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

### Step 5: Update Wiki Navigation
**Description:** Update navigation and cross-references in remaining wiki files
**Files to update:**
- API.md, FAQ.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- Technical guides

**Estimated time:** 2 hours

### Step 6: Validation
**Description:** Verify wiki cleanup is complete and game still works
**Validation steps:**
- Run game with `lovec "engine"`
- Check wiki navigation links
- Ensure no broken references

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Impact
- Wiki folder becomes pure developer documentation
- Clear separation: docs/ = design, wiki/ = developer reference
- Improved navigation for different audiences

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of Phases 1-4
- Depends on docs/ structure being finalized

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- N/A (documentation cleanup)

#### Integration Tests
- Verify game runs after wiki changes
- Check cross-references in wiki files

#### Manual Testing
- Navigate wiki files to ensure proper organization
- Verify no game design content remains

---

## How to Run/Debug

1. **Run game to verify functionality:**
   ```bash
   lovec "engine"
   ```

2. **Check wiki organization:**
   - Browse wiki/ folder structure
   - Verify navigation links work
   - Confirm game design content removed

3. **Debug issues:**
   - Check console output for any loading errors
   - Verify file paths in navigation links

---

## Documentation Updates

### Files to Update
- `wiki/API.md` - Update cross-references if needed
- `wiki/FAQ.md` - Update cross-references if needed
- `wiki/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Update cross-references if needed
- `wiki/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Update navigation

### New Documentation
- Update DOCS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md with Phase 5 completion status
