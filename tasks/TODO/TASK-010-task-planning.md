7. Test coverage improvement
8. Procedural generator maintenance
9. TOML data verification
10. Task planning (this task)

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes - DONE

### Step 2: Create Task Documents
**Description:** Write detailed task files from template  
**Files to create:**
- [x] TASK-001-mod-loading-enhancement.md
- [x] TASK-002-asset-verification.md
- [x] TASK-003-mapblock-validation.md
- [x] TASK-004-map-editor.md

- [x] TASK-007-test-coverage.md
- [x] TASK-008-procedural-generator.md
- [x] TASK-009-toml-data-verification.md
- [x] TASK-010-task-planning.md (this file)

**Estimated time:** 3 hours - DONE

### Step 3: Update tasks.md
**Description:** Add all tasks to central tracking file  
**Files to modify:**
- [ ] `tasks/tasks.md`

**Format:**
```markdown
## High Priority Tasks

### TASK-001: Mod Loading Enhancement
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Files:** engine/systems/mod_manager.lua, engine/main.lua  
**Description:** Ensure mod 'new' loads automatically on startup
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 hours
```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes - IN PROGRESS

### Step 4: Review and Validate
**Description:** Review all task documents for completeness  
**Checklist:**
- [ ] All sections filled in
- [ ] Time estimates realistic
- [ ] Dependencies noted
- [ ] Files identified
- [ ] Tests planned

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

## Implementation Details

### Task Document Structure
Each task follows template:
- Overview and Purpose
- Requirements (Functional, Technical, Acceptance)
- Detailed Plan with steps and time estimates
- Implementation Details (Architecture, Components)
- Testing Strategy
- How to Run/Debug
- Documentation Updates
- Review Checklist

### Task Naming Convention
`TASK-XXX-description.md` where:
- XXX = Sequential number (001-010)
- description = Kebab-case short name

### Task Priority Levels
- **Critical:** Blocks other work, must be done first
- **High:** Important for project success
- **Medium:** Enhances functionality
- **Low:** Nice to have

### Estimated Total Time
| Task | Priority | Time Estimate |
|------|----------|---------------|
| TASK-001: Mod Loading | Critical | 1.5 hours |
| TASK-002: Asset Verification | High | 2 hours |
| TASK-003: Mapblock Validation | High | 3 hours |
| TASK-004: Map Editor | High | 9 hours |
| TASK-005: Widget Organization | Medium | 3 hours |
| TASK-006: New Widgets | Medium | 15 hours |
| TASK-007: Test Coverage | High | 16 hours |
| TASK-008: Procedural Generator | Medium | 5 hours |
| TASK-009: TOML Verification | Critical | 8 hours |
| TASK-010: Task Planning | Critical | 4.5 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | **~68 hours** |

### Recommended Order
1. TASK-010: Task Planning (this) - Foundation
2. TASK-001: Mod Loading - Critical dependency
3. TASK-009: TOML Verification - Data foundation
4. TASK-002: Asset Verification - Content integrity
5. TASK-003: Mapblock Validation - Map system
6. TASK-008: Procedural Generator - Map options
7. TASK-005: Widget Organization - UI foundation
8. TASK-006: New Widgets - UI expansion
9. TASK-004: Map Editor - Major feature
10. TASK-007: Test Coverage - Quality assurance
