**Files to modify/create:**
- `docs/battlescape/weapons.md` - Added weapon comparison tables, damage effectiveness matrix, tactical usage examples
- `docs/battlescape/armors.md` - Added armor comparison matrix, resistance tables, tactical scenarios

**Estimated time:** 3 hours  
**Actual time:** 2.5 hours

### Step 3: Strategic Layer Enhancement (COMPLETED)
**Description:** Enhance geoscape and basescape systems with diagrams and examples  
**Files to modify/create:**
- `docs/geoscape/missions.md` - Added mission generation flow, success probability calculator, tactical examples
- `docs/basescape/README.md` - Added facility grid layout, development progression flow, resource management dashboard

**Estimated time:** 3 hours  
**Actual time:** 2 hours

### Step 4: Remaining Documentation Enhancement
**Description:** Enhance remaining docs/ files with diagrams, examples, and cross-references  
**Files to identify and modify:**
- `docs/geoscape/world-map.md` - Add geographic diagrams and biome examples
- `docs/geoscape/craft-operations.md` - Add interception mechanics and fleet management examples
- `docs/economy/funding.md` - Add economic flowcharts and country relationship matrices
- `docs/economy/manufacturing.md` - Add production pipelines and capacity planning
- `docs/battlescape/maps.md` - Add terrain examples and procedural generation diagrams
- `docs/content/` subdirectory files - Add content creation examples and balance matrices

**Estimated time:** 6 hours

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Network Establishment
**Description:** Add comprehensive cross-references across all docs/ files  
**Tasks:**
- Review all enhanced documents for missing cross-references
- Add "Cross-Reference Integration" sections where missing
- Ensure each document links to related systems appropriately
- Validate all cross-reference links are correct

**Estimated time:** 2 hours

---

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Document Structure**: Maintain existing structure while adding enhancement sections
- **Diagram Standards**: Use Mermaid for all visual elements (flowcharts, gantt, state diagrams, mindmaps)
- **Cross-Reference Format**: Use relative paths with descriptive link text
- **Example Format**: Include practical, game-relevant scenarios

### Components
- **Visual Enhancements**: Mermaid diagrams for complex system interactions
- **Data Tables**: Markdown tables for comparisons, matrices, and balance data
- **Gameplay Examples**: Detailed scenarios showing mechanics in practice
- **Cross-References**: Links to related design documents and implementation files

### Dependencies
- Phase 2 completion (docs/ structure established)
- Access to GAME_DESIGN_DOCS_PLAN.md for Phase 3 requirements
- Existing wiki/ content for reference and gap identification

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [x] Validate Mermaid diagram syntax renders correctly
- [x] Check cross-reference links are valid paths
- [x] Verify table formatting displays properly
- [ ] Test enhanced documents with actual game mechanics

### Integration Testing
- [x] Ensure enhanced documents maintain consistency with existing docs/
- [x] Validate cross-references create logical documentation network
- [ ] Test documentation usability for developers and modders

### Manual Testing
- [x] Review enhanced documents for clarity and completeness
- [x] Check examples accurately represent game mechanics
- [ ] Get feedback from development team on documentation improvements

## How to Run/Debug

### Development Environment
1. Edit documents in VS Code with Markdown preview
2. Use Mermaid preview extensions to validate diagrams
3. Test cross-reference links by navigating between documents

### Validation Steps
1. Open enhanced document in Markdown viewer
2. Verify all Mermaid diagrams render correctly
3. Click cross-reference links to ensure they work
4. Check table formatting displays properly

### Console Commands
```bash
# No console commands needed - documentation enhancement only
```

## What Worked Well

- Mermaid diagrams significantly improve comprehension of complex systems
- Gameplay examples help illustrate abstract mechanics in practice
- Cross-references create better navigation between related systems
- Table-based data presentation makes balance information accessible

## Lessons Learned

- Visual enhancements transform technical documentation into developer-friendly resources
- Examples are crucial for understanding how mechanics interact in practice
- Cross-references should be comprehensive but not overwhelming
- Consistent formatting across documents improves overall usability

## Next Steps

1. Complete enhancement of remaining docs/ files
2. Establish comprehensive cross-reference network
3. Validate all enhancements with development team
4. Prepare for Phase 4: Integration & Linking</content>
