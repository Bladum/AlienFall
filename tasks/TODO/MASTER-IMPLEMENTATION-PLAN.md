- Owner: Developer 2

**Track C: 3D Rendering**
- 3D Core â†’ 3D Units â†’ 3D Effects
- Owner: Developer 3 (can start after Week 1)

**Track D: Base Systems**
- Facilities â†’ Research â†’ Manufacturing â†’ Unit Recovery
- Owner: Developer 4 (can start after Week 1)

**Track E: Economy**
- Marketplace â†’ Black Market â†’ Fame/Karma
- Owner: Developer 5 (can start after Week 5)

**Result:** With 5 developers, ~16 weeks solo becomes ~5-6 weeks parallel

---

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### After Each Phase
1. **Playtest:** Complete a full gameplay loop using new features
2. **Performance:** Check for frame drops, memory leaks (lovec console)
3. **Integration:** Verify new features work with existing systems
4. **Documentation:** Update API.md, FAQ.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
5. **Refactor:** Clean up code, remove debug prints, optimize

### Milestone Validation
- **Phase 1:** Can play a complete mission from start to finish
- **Phase 2:** Can build base and deploy custom loadouts
- **Phase 3:** Missions feel varied and tactical
- **Phase 4:** 3D mode is playable and fun
- **Phase 5:** Combat has depth and variety
- **Phase 6:** Economy feels balanced and meaningful
- **Phase 7:** Strategic layer has long-term goals
- **Phase 8:** Game is feature complete

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
1. **3D Battlescape** (270 hours) - Complex rendering, hex raycasting
   - **Mitigation:** Prototype early, use g3d library, test frequently
   
2. **Map Generation** (60 hours) - Procedural generation bugs
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simple cases, add complexity gradually
   
3. **Geoscape Core** (80 hours) - Many interconnected systems
   - **Mitigation:** Build in layers, test each subsystem independently

### Dependency Chains
- **Geoscape â†’ Everything** - If Geoscape is delayed, entire schedule shifts
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize Geoscape, allocate best developer, test early
  
- **Map Generation â†’ Tactical Combat** - Can't playtest missions without maps
  - **Mitigation:** Use simple test maps during Phase 1, complete map gen ASAP
  
- **Base Facilities â†’ Research/Manufacturing** - Economy blocked without bases
  - **Mitigation:** Create minimal base system first, expand later

### Scope Creep Prevention
- **Hex Combat:** Defer to Phase 8+ (or never if square grid works)
- **Black Market:** Optional feature, can be cut for 1.0
- **Lore/Campaign:** Can be expanded post-1.0 with content updates
- **Psionics:** Optional system, can be simplified or cut
