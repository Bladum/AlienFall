# Task: Geoscape Lore & Mission System - Campaigns, Factions, Events

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Created:** October 13, 2025  
**Completed:** N/A  
**Assigned To:** AI Agent

**Dependencies:** TASK-025 (Geoscape Master Implementation) - Phases 1-4 must be complete

---

## Overview

Complete implementation of the **dynamic mission generation system** that drives gameplay progression through factions, campaigns, missions, quests, and events. This system creates a living, reactive strategic layer where enemy factions escalate their activities over time, missions spawn dynamically, and player actions affect the world state.

This is the **narrative and progression engine** of the game, transforming the static Geoscape into a dynamic strategic challenge.

---

## Purpose

The Lore & Mission System provides:

1. **Dynamic Threat Escalation**: Missions increase from 2/month to 10/month over 2 years
2. **Faction-Based Narrative**: Each faction has unique lore, units, research, and missions
3. **Strategic Progression**: Player researches faction tech to disable their campaigns
4. **Mission Variety**: Sites (static), UFOs (moving), Bases (permanent + spawning)
5. **Campaign Scripts**: Weekly/delayed mission spawning per faction
6. **Quest System**: Flexible conditions, rewards, and penalties
7. **Random Events**: Monthly events affecting resources, relations, missions
8. **Relation-Based Difficulty**: Faction relations (-2 to +2) affect mission frequency/difficulty

Without this system, the Geoscape would be static with no strategic progression or narrative depth.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Calendar Integration
- [ ] **Mission Spawning**: Every 1st day of month, randomly generate new campaigns
- [ ] **Escalation**: Start with 2 campaigns/month (Q1), increase by 1 per quarter
- [ ] **Max Campaigns**: Cap at 10/month after 2 years (8 quarters)
- [ ] **Tech Disabling**: Player can reduce campaigns via faction research progress

#### Faction System
- [ ] **Faction Entity**: Core lore element describing enemy groups/races
- [ ] **Unique Identity**: Each faction has lore, units, items, research tree
- [ ] **Mission Ownership**: All missions belong to a faction
- [ ] **Research Progression**: Player researches faction tech to unlock countermeasures
- [ ] **Final Research**: Disables faction's campaigns/missions permanently
- [ ] **Relations System**: -2 to +2 scale affecting mission frequency/difficulty
- [ ] **Hostile Actions**: Relation -2 triggers special missions (e.g., base assault)

#### Mission System
- [ ] **Mission Types**:
  - **Site**: Static mission waiting to be picked up
  - **UFO**: Moving mission with scripted movement
  - **Base**: Permanent mission that spawns more missions
- [ ] **Province Placement**: Missions exist within provinces
- [ ] **Scoring**: Missions score points against player if not intercepted
- [ ] **Detection**: Radar system reveals missions to player
- [ ] **Expiration**: Missions expire after time limit

#### Campaign System
- [ ] **Campaign Entity**: Script-based mission spawner per faction
- [ ] **Spawning Schedule**: Once per week OR with custom delay
- [ ] **Mission Scripts**: Campaign defines what missions to spawn and when
- [ ] **Tech Disabling**: Campaigns disabled by player research progress
- [ ] **Faction-Specific**: Every campaign belongs to a faction

#### Quest System
- [ ] **Quest Entity**: Flexible condition-based objectives
- [ ] **Conditions**: Check world state (missions completed, tech researched, etc.)
- [ ] **Rewards**: Money, items, tech, relations, faction progress
- [ ] **Penalties**: Negative consequences if conditions not met
- [ ] **Flexible Scripting**: Support complex condition logic

#### Event System
- [ ] **Random Events**: Few per month, not linked to campaigns
- [ ] **Resource Effects**: Modify money, fuel, items
- [ ] **Relation Effects**: Change country or faction relations
- [ ] **Mission Creation**: Events can spawn one-off missions
- [ ] **No Campaign Link**: Independent of faction campaign system

#### Mission Scripts
- [ ] **UFO Script**: Daily updates for UFO movement
  - Move between provinces
  - Land in province
  - Take off
  - Change region
  - Patrol patterns
- [ ] **Base Script**: Growth and spawning logic
  - Base expansion over time
  - Spawn missions from base
  - Increase threat level
  - Trigger special missions

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Data-Driven**: All factions, campaigns, missions defined in TOML files
- [ ] **Script Engine**: Lua-based scripting for campaigns, UFO behavior, base growth
- [ ] **Event Queue**: Priority queue for scheduled events (campaign spawns, UFO updates)
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Save/load faction progress, campaign status, active missions
- [ ] **Performance**: Handle 50+ active missions, 20+ campaigns, 10+ factions
- [ ] **Integration**: Works with Calendar (TASK-025 Phase 2) and Travel System (Phase 4)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Campaigns spawn on 1st of month with escalation (2 â†’ 10 over 8 quarters)
- [ ] Each faction has unique lore, units, research tree
- [ ] Player can research faction tech to disable campaigns
- [ ] Missions spawn via campaign scripts (weekly/delayed)
- [ ] UFO missions move between provinces via scripts
- [ ] Base missions spawn additional missions over time
- [ ] Quest system supports complex conditions and rewards/penalties
- [ ] Random events trigger monthly with resource/relation effects
- [ ] Faction relations affect mission frequency and difficulty
- [ ] Relation -2 triggers special hostile missions (base assault)
- [ ] All systems integrate with Geoscape calendar and province system

    },
    loop = false,
}
```

**UFO Script Actions:**

ScriptEngine:updateScript(missionId, turn) -- Execute next step
ScriptEngine:stopScript(missionId) -- Stop script execution
```

**Example UFO Script:**
```lua
-- data/scripts/ufo_scripts.lua
return {

            {action = "land", params = {biome = "urban", duration = 7}},
            {action = "takeOff"},
            {action = "moveTo", params = {provinceId = "province_001"}},
            {action = "returnToBase"},
        },
        loop = false,
    },
    
    fighter_intercept_01 = {
        id = "fighter_intercept_01",
        type = "ufo",
        steps = {
            {action = "moveTo", params = {targetType = "playerBase"}},
            {action = "attack", params = {duration = 3}},
            {action = "returnToBase"},
        },
        loop = false,
    }
}
```

**Example Base Script:**
```lua
-- data/scripts/base_scripts.lua
return {
    base_growth_standard = {
        id = "base_growth_standard",
        type = "base",
        steps = {
            {action = "wait", params = {turns = 60}},
            {action = "grow"},
            {action = "spawnMission", params = {type = "ufo", script = "scout_patrol_01"}},
            {action = "wait", params = {turns = 14}},
            {action = "spawnMission", params = {type = "site", script = "supply_drop"}},
            {action = "wait", params = {turns = 60}},
            {action = "grow"},
            {action = "upgradeDefenses", params = {hpBonus = 200}},
        },
        loop = true, -- Repeat after all steps

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

**Pattern:** Event-driven with script execution engine

**Components:**
1. **Faction System**: Core identity for enemy groups
2. **Mission System**: Three types (Site, UFO, Base) with distinct behaviors
3. **Campaign System**: Scriptable mission spawning per faction
4. **Script Engine**: Lua-based execution for UFO/base behaviors
5. **Quest System**: Flexible condition-based objectives
6. **Event System**: Random monthly world events
7. **Managers**: Campaign, Mission, Quest, Event managers
8. **Turn Integration**: Monthly/weekly/daily triggers

**Data Flow:**
```
Calendar Turn â†’ Turn Processor
    â†“
Campaign Manager (monthly spawning)
    â†“
Campaign Scripts (weekly mission spawning)
    â†“
Mission Manager (daily updates)
    â†“
Script Engine (UFO movement, base growth)
    â†“
World State Update
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Script Engine**: Lua-based for flexibility and modding support
2. **Turn-Based**: All updates triggered by turn advancement, not real-time
3. **Escalation**: Linear growth (2 â†’ 10) over 8 quarters
4. **Faction Disabling**: Final research removes all faction content
5. **Quest Flexibility**: Support AND/OR logic for complex conditions
6. **Event Independence**: Events not tied to campaigns for variety
7. **Grid-Snapped UI**: All UI at 24Ã—24 pixel grid for consistency

### Dependencies

**Internal (TASK-025 Geoscape):**
- Calendar system (Phase 2) - Required for turn-based spawning
- Province system (Phase 1) - Required for mission placement
- World data (Phase 1) - Required for region/biome targeting
- Turn processor (Phase 8) - Extended for lore systems

**External:**
- Research system (Basescape) - For faction disabling
- Combat system (Battlescape) - For mission interception
- UI widgets (from widget system) - For panels and displays

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

2. Advance to 1st of month â†’ Verify campaigns spawn
3. Check mission icons on map
4. Advance 7 turns â†’ Verify weekly mission spawning
5. Advance to 15th â†’ Verify events trigger
6. Complete quest conditions â†’ Verify rewards
7. Advance to Q2 â†’ Verify 3 campaigns spawn

- [ ] `wiki/LORE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Create comprehensive guide

---

## Notes

### Escalation Formula
```lua
campaignsPerMonth = min(
    baseCampaigns + (quarter - 1) * escalationRate,
    maxCampaigns
)

-- Examples:
Q1: 2 + (1-1)*1 = 2
Q2: 2 + (2-1)*1 = 3
Q3: 2 + (3-1)*1 = 4
Q4: 2 + (4-1)*1 = 5
Q5: 2 + (5-1)*1 = 6
Q6: 2 + (6-1)*1 = 7
Q7: 2 + (7-1)*1 = 8
Q8: 2 + (8-1)*1 = 9
Q9: 2 + (9-1)*1 = 10 (capped)
```

### Faction Disabling Impact
- All faction campaigns removed
- All faction missions removed
- Faction marked as disabled
- No new missions spawn for that faction
- Reduces total campaigns per month

### Performance Considerations
- Cache active missions by type (Site/UFO/Base)
- Limit script updates to active (non-intercepted) missions
- Use spatial hash for mission detection
- Lazy-load quest conditions (only check active quests)
- Event pool caching (pre-filter available events)

---

## Blockers

### Prerequisites
- **TASK-025 Phases 1-4**: Calendar, Province, World, Travel systems must be complete
- **Research System**: Needed for faction disabling (Basescape task)
- **UI Widgets**: Needed for panels and displays (Phase 7)

### External Dependencies
- **Combat System**: Needed for mission interception outcomes
- **Basescape**: Research tree integration
