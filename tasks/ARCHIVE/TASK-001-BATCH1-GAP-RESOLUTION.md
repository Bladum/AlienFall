# TASK-001: Batch 1 Gap Resolution

**Task ID:** TASK-001
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Created:** October 23, 2025
**Target Completion:** October 23, 2025
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Overview

Resolve and implement missing content identified in first 5 gap analysis files:
1. AI_SYSTEMS.md - Implement confidence system, verify action point ranges
2. ANALYTICS.md - Add PerformanceMonitor/ReportBuilder entities (low priority)
3. ASSETS.md - Document inventory/procurement systems completely
4. BASESCAPE.md - Fix grid dimension clarification and power value
5. BATTLESCAPE.md - Implement accuracy formula, concealment detection, explosion system

**Outcome:** All gaps resolved, 5 gap files deleted

---

## AI_SYSTEMS.md Resolution

**Current Status:** ✅ 3 of 3 critical gaps resolved (per gap analysis)
**Action:** CLOSE - Already implemented in previous session
**Delete File:** YES

- [x] Action Points Range (1-4) documented
- [x] Threat Scoring Formula documented
- [x] Confidence System implemented

---

## ANALYTICS.md Resolution

**Current Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT alignment - NO CRITICAL GAPS
**Action:** DOCUMENT MINOR ENTITIES
**Delete File:** YES (no gaps to fix)

**Changes:**
- [ ] Verify PerformanceMonitor entity structure in API
- [ ] Verify ReportBuilder entity structure in API
- [ ] Update Systems documentation with brief mention of these entities (optional)

---

## ASSETS.md Resolution

**Current Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS - Inventory/Procurement systems missing from Systems
**Action:** IMPLEMENT OR CLARIFY
**Delete File:** CONDITIONAL (only if clarified)

**Changes:**
- [ ] Check if inventory/procurement systems exist in engine/assets/
- [ ] If exist: Document in engine/assets/README.md
- [ ] If don't exist: Mark as "planned feature" in API
- [ ] Update ASSETS API with correct status
- [ ] Verify storage capacity values (5000 in API)
- [ ] Verify inter-base transfer system exists

---

## BASESCAPE.md Resolution

**Current Status:** ✅ MOSTLY ALIGNED - Only 2 minor value conflicts
**Action:** CLARIFY VALUES
**Delete File:** YES

**Changes:**
- [ ] Fix grid dimension confusion: Update API to clarify 40×60 is rendering viewport, playable grids are 4×4 to 7×7
- [ ] Resolve power plant output: Verify if 50 or 100 (recommend 50 per Systems)
- [ ] Update Basescape API file with corrections

---

## BATTLESCAPE.md Resolution

**Current Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS - 9 critical, 15 moderate gaps
**Action:** IMPLEMENT ALL CRITICAL FORMULAS
**Delete File:** CONDITIONAL (only if all gaps resolved)

**Critical Gaps to Fix:**
- [ ] Action Points Range: Document 1-4 AP system with stacking rules
- [ ] Accuracy Formula: Complete formula with range modifiers, cover, clamping
- [ ] Concealment Detection: Document or mark as "planned feature"
- [ ] Explosion Damage: Document propagation formula
- [ ] Cover Values: Complete table of obstacle cover values
- [ ] Weapon Mode Modifiers: Document AP/accuracy/damage for each mode
- [ ] Line of Sight Costs: Complete table for all terrain types
- [ ] Terrain Armor: Document armor values for destruction
- [ ] AP Penalty Stacking: Clear rules for health/morale/sanity combinations

**Minor Tasks:**
- [ ] Map block hex arrangement pattern clarification
- [ ] Landing zone count documentation
- [ ] Sight range value reconciliation (10 vs 16/8)
- [ ] Projectile deviation system documentation
- [ ] Critical hit mechanics documentation
- [ ] Objective types list

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Current Engine State
1. Check engine/ai/ for actual implementations
2. Check engine/assets/ for inventory systems
3. Check engine/basescape/ for base mechanics
4. Check engine/battlescape/ for combat formulas

### Step 2: Update Documentation
1. Update api/AI_SYSTEMS.md if needed
2. Update api/ANALYTICS.md with entity details
3. Update api/ASSETS.md with system status
4. Update api/BASESCAPE.md with clarifications
5. Update api/BATTLESCAPE.md with complete formulas

### Step 3: Implement Missing Systems
1. If inventory system missing: Create engine/assets/inventory_system.lua
2. If procurement missing: Create engine/assets/procurement_system.lua
3. If concealment detection missing: Create engine/battlescape/concealment_system.lua
4. If explosion system incomplete: Enhance engine/battlescape/explosion_system.lua

### Step 4: Test & Validate
1. Run game with debug console: `lovec "engine"`
2. Verify no crashes or errors
3. Check that systems load correctly
4. Validate balance values make sense

### Step 5: Delete Gap Files
1. Delete design/gaps/AI_SYSTEMS.md
2. Delete design/gaps/ANALYTICS.md
3. Delete design/gaps/ASSETS.md
4. Delete design/gaps/BASESCAPE.md
5. Delete design/gaps/BATTLESCAPE.md

## Files to Modify

### Documentation Updates
- `api/AI_SYSTEMS.md` - Verify complete
- `api/ANALYTICS.md` - Add entity details
- `api/ASSETS.md` - Update with system status
- `api/BASESCAPE.md` - Fix grid/power clarifications
- `api/BATTLESCAPE.md` - Add complete formulas

### Engine Updates
- `engine/ai/` - May need enhancements
- `engine/assets/` - May need new systems
- `engine/basescape/` - Minor clarifications
- `engine/battlescape/` - May need concealment/explosion systems

### Gap File Deletions
- `design/gaps/AI_SYSTEMS.md` ✓
- `design/gaps/ANALYTICS.md` ✓
- `design/gaps/ASSETS.md` ✓
- `design/gaps/BASESCAPE.md` ✓
- `design/gaps/BATTLESCAPE.md` ✓

## Success Criteria

- [x] AI_SYSTEMS.md gaps resolved or confirmed complete
- [ ] ANALYTICS.md reviewed and confirmed (no changes needed)
- [ ] ASSETS.md gaps either implemented or documented as planned
- [ ] BASESCAPE.md values corrected and clarified
- [ ] BATTLESCAPE.md critical formulas documented
- [ ] All 5 gap files deleted
- [ ] Game runs without errors
- [ ] No crashes when testing systems

---

## Notes

- All gap files contain excellent analysis - use them as source of truth for what needs fixing
- Gap files often identify when API documents invented mechanics not in Systems - resolve by updating Systems first
- Focus on critical gaps first, nice-to-have gaps can be documented for future work
- After resolving, delete gap file from design/gaps/ folder
