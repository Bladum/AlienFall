# TASK-GAP-005: Compare Empty Systems vs Design Requirements

**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** October 23, 2025
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Task Type:** Gap Analysis + Planning

---

## Overview

Identify completely empty/missing systems and map their design requirements to understand what needs to be built.

---

## Scope: TWO SOURCES ONLY

**Source A:** `design/mechanics/` + `api/` (what's designed)
**Source B:** `engine/` (actual implementation)

**Missing Systems to Analyze:**
1. Tutorial System
2. Portal System
3. Network System
4. Accessibility System

---

## System 1: Tutorial System

**Engine Status:** ‚ùå **EMPTY** (skeleton only)
- `engine/tutorial/tutorial_manager.lua` - Exists but empty
- No tutorial UI
- No tutorial progression
- No tutorial content

**Design Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** (some specs, needs detail)
- Design exists in `design/mechanics/` but sparse
- No detailed specifications
- No content defined

**API Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**
- No `api/TUTORIAL.md`
- No formal specification

**Analysis Tasks:**
- [ ] What is designed for tutorial?
- [ ] What content exists?
- [ ] How should it integrate with game?
- [ ] What should progression look like?
- [ ] What systems does it need?

**Design Questions to Answer:**
1. Is tutorial mandatory for first play?
2. Difficulty-specific tutorials?
3. Tutorial missions or overlay?
4. Skip option available?
5. Replayable?

**Output:**
- Missing design doc: `design/mechanics/Tutorial.md`
- Missing API doc: `api/TUTORIAL.md`
- Implementation plan: `tasks/TODO/TASK-IMPLEMENT-TUTORIAL.md`

## System 2: Portal System

**Engine Status:** ‚ùå **EMPTY** (skeleton only)
- `engine/portal/portal_system.lua` - Exists but empty
- No portal mechanics
- No dimensional rift system
- No rendering

**Design Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**
- No portal specifications
- No mechanics defined
- No content

**API Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**
- No `api/PORTAL.md`

**Analysis Tasks:**
- [ ] What is purpose of portals?
- [ ] Are they for Phase 3 (Deep War) only?
- [ ] How do they work mechanically?
- [ ] Strategic or tactical layer?
- [ ] Permanent or temporary?

**Design Questions to Answer:**
1. What triggers portal creation?
2. Where do portals lead?
3. How are they destroyed?
4. Strategic impact?
5. Connected to Dimensional War phase?

**Output:**
- Design doc needed: `design/mechanics/Portal.md`
- Missing API doc: `api/PORTAL.md`
- Implementation plan: `tasks/TODO/TASK-IMPLEMENT-PORTAL.md`

---

## System 3: Network/Multiplayer System

**Engine Status:** ‚ùå **EMPTY** (README only)
- `engine/network/README.md` - Description only
- No implementation
- No infrastructure

**Design Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**
- No multiplayer specifications
- No mechanics defined

**API Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING**
- No `api/NETWORK.md`

**Analysis Tasks:**
- [ ] Is multiplayer in MVP or post-launch?
- [ ] What type: competitive or cooperative?
- [ ] Platform: online or local?
- [ ] Scale: 2 players or 4+?
- [ ] Architecture: P2P or server-based?

**Design Questions to Answer:**
1. Multiplayer scope for MVP?
2. Game modes (PvP, co-op)?
3. Synchronization strategy?
4. Latency tolerance?
5. Account/progression sharing?

**Output:**
- Product decision needed: Is this MVP or post-launch?
- Design doc: `design/mechanics/Network.md` (pending decision)
- Missing API doc: `api/NETWORK.md` (pending decision)
- Implementation plan: `tasks/TODO/TASK-IMPLEMENT-NETWORK.md` (pending decision)

## System 4: Accessibility System

**Engine Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINIMAL** (30% done)
- `engine/accessibility/` folder exists
- Colorblind mode (partial)
- Missing most features

**Design Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
- No comprehensive design
- No specifications

**API Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINIMAL**
- No formal `api/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
- Specifications scattered

**Existing Implementation:**
- Colorblind modes (partial)
- Missing:
  - [ ] Text-to-speech
  - [ ] Audio descriptions
  - [ ] Screen reader support
  - [ ] High contrast themes
  - [ ] Font scaling
  - [ ] Control remapping
  - [ ] Keyboard-only mode

**Analysis Tasks:**
- [ ] What accessibility features are priority?
- [ ] Which platforms need support?
- [ ] What standards (WCAG, ADA)?
- [ ] What are user personas?
- [ ] How to test accessibility?

**Design Questions to Answer:**
1. Target accessibility level (A, AA, AAA)?
2. Languages with RTL support needed?
3. Text-to-speech engine choice?
4. High contrast color palettes?
5. Testing with actual users?

**Output:**
- Design doc needed: `design/mechanics/Accessibility.md`
- API doc needed: `api/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
- Implementation plan: `tasks/TODO/TASK-IMPLEMENT-ACCESSIBILITY.md`

## Deliverables

### Gap Assessment Report
**File:** `docs/EMPTY_SYSTEMS_ASSESSMENT.md`

For each system, document:
1. **Current State:** What exists now
2. **Required State:** What needs to be built
3. **Design Gaps:** What's not designed
4. **Implementation Gap:** What code is needed
5. **Effort Estimate:** Time to complete
6. **Blockers:** What's preventing work
7. **Dependencies:** What must be done first

### Design Documents Needed
Create or update:
- [ ] `design/mechanics/Tutorial.md` (if missing)
- [ ] `design/mechanics/Portal.md` (if missing)
- [ ] `design/mechanics/Network.md` (if needed)
- [ ] `design/mechanics/Accessibility.md` (if missing)

### API Documents Needed
Create:
- [ ] `api/TUTORIAL.md`
- [ ] `api/PORTAL.md`
- [ ] `api/NETWORK.md` (pending product decision)
- [ ] `api/ACCESSIBILITY.md`

### Implementation Tasks
Create implementation tasks once design is finalized:
- [ ] TASK-IMPLEMENT-TUTORIAL (20-30h)
- [ ] TASK-IMPLEMENT-PORTAL (15-25h, pending design)
- [ ] TASK-IMPLEMENT-NETWORK (40-60h, pending requirements)
- [ ] TASK-IMPLEMENT-ACCESSIBILITY (15-20h)
