## Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- engine/economy/production/manufacturing_system.lua (421 lines)
- mods/core/manufacturing/items.toml (15+ equipment types)
- mods/core/manufacturing/units.toml (5+ unit types)
- mods/core/manufacturing/crafts.toml (8+ craft types)

**Modified:**
- engine/core/data_loader.lua - Added manufacturing loaders
- engine/scenes/basescape_screen.lua - Manufacturing UI integration
- engine/core/automation_system.lua - Automated manufacturing

## Architecture

**Data Layer:**
- TOML files define all manufacturing entries
- Material costs, engineer-hours, prerequisites
- Support for all production types

**Logic Layer:**
- ManufacturingSystem: Manages production queue
- Per-base independent systems
- Daily progression calculation

**System Layer:**
- Calendar integration for daily updates
- Facility integration for capacity
- Inventory system for materials/outputs

**UI Layer:**
- Production queue visualization
- Progress bars for active items
- Material cost preview
- Engineer allocation controls

## Testing

**Unit Tests:**
- ✅ Project definition from TOML
- ✅ Material availability checking
- ✅ Daily progression calculation
- ✅ Completion detection
- ✅ Batch production math

**Integration Tests:**
- ✅ Multiple bases have independent production
- ✅ Workshop capacity limits projects
- ✅ Materials consumed at start
- ✅ Research prerequisites enforced
- ✅ Outputs added to inventory

**Manual Testing:**
- ✅ Start manufacturing in base
- ✅ Allocate engineers
- ✅ Advance calendar and see progress
- ✅ Complete production
- ✅ Items appear in inventory

## Performance

- Project lookup: O(1) via hash table
- Daily progression: O(n) where n = active projects per base
- Material checking: O(m) where m = material types
- UI update: Only on changes

## Documentation

- ✅ API.md updated with ManufacturingSystem API
- ✅ FAQ.md updated with "How to manufacture" guide
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md updated with architecture
- ✅ Code comments and docstrings throughout

## Known Limitations

1. Manufacturing is per-base (by design, different from research)
2. No queue prioritization UI (could be added)
3. No partial completion cancellation (all or nothing)
4. No manufacturing cancellation penalty

## What Worked Well

- Clean TOML-based configuration system
- Per-base independent production allows complexity
- Material system prevents exploitation
- Event system allows clean integration

## Lessons Learned

- Per-base complexity vs global simplicity tradeoff well-executed
- Material costs prevent excessive production
- Engineer allocation similar to scientist allocation pattern

## How to Run/Debug

```bash
lovec "engine"
```

In-game testing:
1. Create base with workshop
2. Hire engineers
3. Open Manufacturing screen (Basescape)
4. View available items to manufacture
5. Start manufacturing (e.g., 10 laser rifles)
6. Allocate engineers (8-12)
7. Advance calendar 1-30 days
8. Watch progress bar update
9. Production completes when progress = 100%
10. Items appear in base inventory

Debug output (Love2D console):
```
[ManufacturingSystem] Started manufacturing 'Laser Rifle' x10 with 8 engineers
[ManufacturingSystem] 'Laser Rifle' progress: 45/500 (+8)
[ManufacturingSystem] PRODUCTION COMPLETE: Laser Rifle x10
```

## Alignment with Design Docs

- ✅ Matches docs/economy/manufacturing/framework.md design
- ✅ Follows XCOM-style production progression
- ✅ Per-base capacity matches design
- ✅ Material cost system matches specs
- ✅ Daily progression mechanics correct

## Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

1. **Enhancement:** Queue prioritization
2. **Enhancement:** Batch size optimization
3. **Enhancement:** Production speed modifiers
4. **Enhancement:** Failure rate simulation
5. **Bug Fixes:** None identified
