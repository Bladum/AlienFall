# ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL_005: Resolve Unit Stat Ranges

**Severity**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Blocker For**: Character progression, equipment balance, achievement system
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
**Dependencies**: C4 (Master Stat Table) - should be parallel/sequential

---

## OVERVIEW

**Problem**: Unit stat ranges are inconsistent across different files:

1. **Primary Definition (Units.md)**: Claims 6-12 for most stats
2. **Alternate Reference (Pilots.md)**: Claims 0-100 for Piloting
3. **Implied by Examples (Battlescape.md)**: Some references suggest 0-20 range
4. **Items.md References**: Equipment bonuses use different scaling
5. **Achievement System**: Lacks stat thresholds

**Current Contradictions**:
- What does "high Aim" mean? 10? 12? 90 out of 100?
- Can stats ever exceed 12? (Some traits suggest yes)
- What's the minimum? (Crippled units = 1? 0? undefined?)
- How do modifiers stack? (Traits + equipment + status effects)

**Impact**:
- Equipment balance impossible without knowing stat ranges
- Achievement design can't set meaningful thresholds
- Unit generation may create invalid characters
- Stat displays ambiguous to players ("92 Aim" vs "11 Aim"?)

**Solution**: Establish definitive, consistent stat ranges and enforce them everywhere.

---

## DESIGN SPECIFICATION

### Section 1: Comprehensive Stat Range Audit

#### Current Contradictions Identified

**Issue 1: Piloting Stat Range**
```
Units.md Line 1187:    "Piloting Stat: 6-12 Scale"
Pilots.md Line 70:     "Piloting is a unit stat (0-100 range)"
Pilots.md Line 80:     "Every 100 XP gained: +1 Piloting"
Pilots.md Line 86-89:  "Scout +10 Piloting, Gunner +5 Piloting"

Resolution: C1 must be completed first
Likely Outcome: 6-12 scale (matches all others), Pilots.md is outdated
```

**Issue 2: Stat Maximums**
```
Units.md claims:       "Maximum is 12"
Traits.md suggests:    Some traits allow exceeding 12 (e.g., "Superhuman Strength")
Economics imply:       High-rank units might reach 13-15 after 100 missions

Resolution: Clarify hard caps vs soft caps
- Hard cap: Absolute max (always enforced)
- Soft cap: Balance point (gains slow down)
```

**Issue 3: Minimum Values**
```
Units.md specifies:    "Minimum 6"
Injuries might create: Less than 6?
Permanently disabled:  At what stat value?

Resolution: Define recovery and permanent injury mechanics
```

**Issue 4: Stat Distribution**
```
Rookies:              6-8 typical
Elite soldiers:       10-12 typical
But what about       extreme outliers?
10 rookies generated  = any guarantee of distribution?
```

### Section 2: Definitive Stat Range Specification

#### Standard Ranges (Apply to all combat stats)

```
Stat Category       Min     Soft Cap  Hard Cap  Typical Range
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Combat Stats        6       10        12        6-12
(Aim, Melee,
 Reaction, Speed,
 Bravery, Sanity)

Specialty Stats     Varies  Varies    Varies    See below
(Strength,
 Piloting, Hacking)

Psychic Stat        2       8         12        2-12 (asymmetric)
(Unique case)
```

#### Stat-by-Stat Range Breakdown

**COMBAT STATS - Standard 6-12 Range**

| Stat | Min | Soft Cap | Hard Cap | Below Min | Above Max | Notes |
|------|-----|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Aim** | 6 | 10 | 12 | Never occurs (rookies 6+) | Elite + trait | Can exceed 12 with specific traits |
| **Melee** | 6 | 10 | 12 | Combat injury | Specialized training | Combat veterancy can exceed 12 |
| **Reaction** | 6 | 10 | 12 | Shellshock (-2) | Rare trait | Genetic condition rare |
| **Speed** | 6 | 10 | 12 | Injury (-2 to -4) | Rare trait | Superhuman speed unusual |
| **Bravery** | 5 | 9 | 12 | Permanently broken (<2) | Iron will trait | Can start below 6 |
| **Sanity** | 1 | 8 | 12 | Full breakdown (<1) | Trained psychologist | Psychotic state possible |

**SPECIALTY STATS - Variable Ranges**

| Stat | Min | Soft Cap | Hard Cap | Application | Notes |
|------|-----|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Strength** | 3 | 10 | 15 | Carry capacity, melee dmg | Can exceed 12; superhuman possible |
| **Piloting** | 2 | 9 | 12 | Craft control, evasion | Once C1 resolved; starts lower for non-pilots |
| **Hacking** | 4 | 9 | 12 | Terminal/UFO hacking | Optional system; specialists only |

**PSYCHIC STAT - Exception Case**

| Property | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Min** | 0 | Non-psychics have Psychic = 0 |
| **Starting** | 2 | Rare birth trait |
| **Soft Cap** | 8 | Balance point |
| **Hard Cap** | 12 | Same as combat stats |
| **Acquisition** | Trait-locked | Only psychic units have this |
| **Scaling** | Different? | May use different bonus formula |

#### Health Points - Special Case

**Not a "stat" but needs range definition**:
```
Unit Type       Base HP    Min         Max         Notes
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Soldier         100        50 (crit)   150 (rare)  Standard
Heavy           150        100         200         Tank role
Scout           75         50          100         Glass cannon
Medic           90         60          120         Support

Modifiers:
- Injury reduces max HP by 5-25%
- Armor provides damage reduction, not HP bonus
- Strength +1 = +5 HP (equipment effect)
```

### Section 3: Stat Soft Caps & Progression Boundaries

#### Soft Cap Mechanics

**What is a Soft Cap?**
- At soft cap, experience gains/stat increases slow down
- Encourages diverse unit development
- Prevents single unit domination
- Balances unit progression across roster

**Soft Cap Rules**:

```
Tier 1: Below Soft Cap (Rookie progression)
  - Gains: Full rate
  - Duration: Missions 1-20
  - Typical result: Reach soft cap by rank 4-5

Tier 2: At Soft Cap (Elite progression)
  - Gains: 75% rate
  - Duration: Missions 20-50
  - Typical result: Reach 11-12 by rank 6-7

Tier 3: Above Soft Cap (Veteran mastery)
  - Gains: 50% rate
  - Duration: Missions 50+
  - Typical result: Rare to exceed hard cap
```

**Implementation**:
```lua
function apply_soft_cap_penalty(stat_gain, current_stat, soft_cap, hard_cap)
    if current_stat < soft_cap then
        return stat_gain  -- Full gains
    elseif current_stat < hard_cap then
        return stat_gain * 0.75  -- 75% gains at soft cap
    else
        return 0  -- No gains at hard cap
    end
end
```

### Section 4: Range Consistency Rules

#### Universal Rules (Apply Everywhere)

**Rule 1: 6-12 Scale is Standard**
```
ANY new stat must default to 6-12 range
Exceptions require explicit design decision documented in Design Decisions Log
```

**Rule 2: Minimum Never Below Min Defined**
```
Aim cannot fall below 6 through any mechanic
Exception: Permanent injury (special case)
```

**Rule 3: Hard Cap is Hard**
```
No normal mechanic can exceed hard cap
Traits/perks may grant temporary bypass
Only very rare trait allows permanent bypass
```

**Rule 4: Stat Display Consistency**
```
UI shows "Aim: 10" not "Aim: 10/12" (redundant)
UI shows "Health: 85/100" (current/max, exception)
Tooltips show range on hover: "Aim (6-12)"
```

### Section 5: Stat Modifier Stacking

#### How Modifiers Combine

**Problem**: Current system unclear about stacking
- Traits give +1-+2 each
- Equipment gives +1
- Status effects give -1 to -4
- What's the total? How many can stack?

**Solution: Explicit Stacking Rules**

#### Stacking Hierarchy

**Permanent Modifiers (applied first, stack normally)**:
```
Base Stat (6-12)
  + Trait 1 bonus
  + Trait 2 bonus
  + Class bonus
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  = Modified Base Stat
```

**Equipment Modifiers (add to modified base)**:
```
Modified Base Stat
  + Armor bonus
  + Weapon bonus
  + Accessory bonus
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  = Equipment-Enhanced Stat
```

**Status Effect Modifiers (applied last, can go negative)**:
```
Equipment-Enhanced Stat
  - Suppression penalty
  - Wound penalty
  - Burn penalty
  - Stun penalty
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  = Final Combat Stat

Final stat: Cannot go below 1 (minimum competence)
Final stat: Capped at hard cap (12 for most)
```

#### Stacking Limits

```
Trait bonuses:     Maximum 2 traits affecting same stat
Equipment bonuses: Maximum 3 items affecting same stat
Status penalties:  Stack normally (multiple debuffs allowed)

Example:
  Aim 8 (base)
  + Quick Shot trait (+1) = 9
  + Sniper trait (+1) = 10
  + Scope equipment (+1) = 11
  - Suppressed (-2) = 9 final

Traits limit prevents stacking bonuses infinitely
Equipment limit prevents stacking optimal gear
Status effects allowed to stack for tactical challenge
```

### Section 6: Out-of-Range Scenarios

#### What Happens When Stat Would Go Out of Range?

**Scenario 1: Stat Gains Would Exceed Hard Cap**
```
Rule: Clamp to hard cap
Example: Veteran at 12 Aim gains XP â†’ still 12 Aim
Design: Encourages roster diversification
```

**Scenario 2: Injury Reduces Stat Below Minimum**
```
Rule: Stat reduced but not below minimum
Example: Veteran 11 Aim, arm broken â†’ 8 Aim (minimum 6)
Recovery: +1 per week in base hospital
Design: Injuries matter but aren't permanent
```

**Scenario 3: Permanent Disability**
```
Rule: Some injuries permanently reduce max stat
Example: "Nerve damage" trait: Max Aim = 9 (permanent)
Acceptance: Unit still playable, different role
Design: Retirement or reassignment
```

**Scenario 4: Multiple Status Effects Drop Stat Below 1**
```
Rule: Minimum 1 (can barely function)
Example: Suppressed (-2), wounded (-1), stunned (-2) = below 0
Result: Stat effective 1 (5% base effectiveness)
Design: Heavily wounded soldiers nearly useless
```

### Section 7: Stat Range Reference for Each System

#### Combat System (Battlescape.md)
```
Stats used: Aim, Melee, Reaction, Speed
Range: Always 6-12
Modifiers applied: Equipment, traits, status, morale
Display: "Aim: 10" (integer only)
Formula examples:
  Accuracy = base_accuracy Ã— (1 + (aim_stat - 6) Ã— 0.05)
  Initiative = base_init Ã— (reaction_stat / 9)
```

#### Equipment System (Items.md)
```
Stats used: Aim, Melee, Strength
Range: 6-12 (standard) or 5-15 (Strength special)
Bonuses: +1 typical (equipment does NOT stack with stats)
Formula:
  Carry capacity = 50 + (strength_stat - 5) Ã— 2
  Melee damage = base_damage Ã— (1 + (melee_stat - 6) Ã— 0.03)
```

#### Progression System (Units.md)
```
Stats used: All (Aim, Melee, Reaction, Speed, Bravery, Sanity)
Range: 6-12 (hard cap at 12, soft cap at 10)
Gain rate: 0.05-0.2 per mission (depends on stat)
Soft cap penalty: 75% gains from rank 5+, 50% from rank 6+
```

#### Morale System (MoraleBraverySanity.md)
```
Stats used: Bravery, Sanity (not standard 6-12)
Bravery: 5-12 range (can start lower due to recruits)
Sanity: 1-12 range (psychotic episodes possible)
Effect: Morale loss = Base Ã— (1 - (Bravery - 5) Ã— 0.05)
```

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Stat Generation Respects Ranges**
```
Create 1000 rookie units, verify:
- All Aim stats in 6-8 range
- No stats below 6 (except Bravery/Sanity)
- No stats above 12 (except Strength)
```

**Scenario 2: Soft Cap Slows Progression**
```
Simulate veteran unit gaining XP:
- Rank 1-3: Stats gain at normal rate
- Rank 4-5: Stats gain at 75% rate
- Rank 6+: Stats gain at 50% rate
- Rank 7: Verify hard cap at 12
```

**Scenario 3: Stacking Rules Enforced**
```
Unit with:
- Trait 1 bonus: +1 Aim
- Trait 2 bonus: +1 Aim (allow 2 traits max)
- Trait 3 bonus: +1 Aim (BLOCK - exceeds limit)
Final: Only traits 1 & 2 applied
```

**Scenario 4: Out of Range Clamping**
```
Status effects reduce Aim from 10:
- Suppression -2 â†’ Aim 8 âœ“
- Wound -2 â†’ Aim 6 (minimum, can't go lower) âœ“
- Additional -1 â†’ Still 6 (clamped) âœ“
```

**Scenario 5: Range Display Correct**
```
UI shows:
- Aim: 10 (with tooltip "6-12")
- Health: 85/100 (shows current/max)
- Suppressed unit: Red indicator on Aim stat
```
