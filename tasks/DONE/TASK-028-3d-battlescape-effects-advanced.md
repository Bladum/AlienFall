## Implementation Details

### Architecture

**Module Design:**
- EffectsRenderer: Independent effect management
- View3D: Integrator (manages EffectsRenderer lifecycle)
- Battlescape_screen: Consumer (View3D handles 3D logic)

**Data Flow:**
```
Game events (fire, explosion, damage)
  ↓
EffectsRenderer:addFire() / addSmoke() / addExplosion()
  ↓
Effects list storage
  ↓
View3D:update()
  ↓
EffectsRenderer:update(dt)
  ↓
Animation frame update, expiration checks
  ↓
View3D:draw()
  ↓
EffectsRenderer:drawEffects()
  ↓
Sort by distance, draw front-to-back
  ↓
Screen output with effects
```

### Key Components

**EffectsRenderer Module** (550+ lines):
- Fire effect system (4-frame animation)
- Smoke effect system (fade + rise)
- Explosion system (multi-frame with radius)
- Static objects (trees, tables, fences)
- Animation timing and lifecycle
- Distance sorting
- Effect queries

**View3D Integration** (3 changes):
- Import EffectsRenderer
- Initialize in constructor
- Update effects in update()
- Draw effects in draw()

**Battlescape_screen Integration** (0 changes required)

Ctrl+Shift+P > "Run XCOM Simple Game"
```

### Debugging Effects
```lua
-- Debug output to console
print("[EffectsRenderer] Added fire at (" .. x .. ", " .. y .. ")")
print("[EffectsRenderer] Fire duration: " .. duration .. " Intensity: " .. intensity)
print("[EffectsRenderer] Active effects: " .. #renderer.effects)

-- On-screen debug info
love.graphics.print("Effects: " .. #effects, 10, 70)
```

### Console Output to Check
Look for these messages:
```
[View3D] Mode switched to 3D view
[EffectsRenderer] Effects rendering...
```

### Temporary Files
