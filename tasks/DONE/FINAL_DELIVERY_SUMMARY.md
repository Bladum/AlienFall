## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Immediate Action

1. **Review CRITICAL specs first** (5 specs, 21 hours)
   - These unlock all other development
   - Provide foundation for remaining systems

2. **Schedule CRITICAL implementation** (Week 1-2 of development)
   - Pilot stats, Strength, Economy, AP, Crafts
   - Core systems that everything else depends on

3. **Plan HIGH priority implementation** (Week 2-4)
   - 8 high-priority specs, 24 hours total
   - Major systems affecting multiple layers

4. **Create extended LOW priority specs** (Ongoing)
   - 64 remaining LOW issues
   - Polish phase after core systems working

### For Long-Term Success

1. **Treat specs as living documents**
   - Update during development if needed
   - Track decisions vs recommendations

2. **Reference test scenarios during QA**
   - Use provided test scenarios as templates
   - Create formal test cases for coverage

3. **Create balance patch documentation**
   - Tuning parameters identified for each spec
   - Easy to adjust difficulty without redesign

4. **Maintain traceability throughout**
   - Keep specs updated as implementation reveals issues
   - Preserve connection to original gap analysis
