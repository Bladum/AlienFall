    itemId = "plasma_rifle",
    karmaImpact = -10,        -- Loss per purchase
    fameRisk = 5,             -- 5% chance for fame damage if discovered
    stock = 3,                -- Very limited

## Ethical Gameplay Implications: VERIFIED ✅

### Moral Choices ✅
- **Ethical Dilemma**: Players must balance power (illegal items) vs morality (karma loss)
- **Consequences**: Getting caught has real costs (funding, relations)
- **Risk/Reward**: High-power items require high risk
- **Narrative**: Reflects player choices in fame system
- **Progression**: Unlocking black market levels through missions

### Risk Mechanics ✅
- **Discovery Risk**: Increases with quantity (bigger purchases = bigger risk)
- **Fame Effect**: Higher fame = more scrutiny
- **Regional Factor**: Some regions safer than others
- **Stacking**: Multiple purchases increase overall risk
- **Consequences**: Significant impact on gameplay

---

## Testing Performed ✅

### Unit Tests ✅
- Discovery chance calculation
- Consequence application
- Stock management
- Regional filtering
- Tier unlocking
- Karma modification

### Integration Tests ✅
- Purchase → Karma system
- Discovery → Fame system
- Consequences → Relations system
- Funding cuts → Finance system
- Monthly → Stock refresh
- Cascading effects

### Manual Verification ✅
- Discovery odds realistic
- Consequences meaningful
- Stock limits enforced
- Regional restrictions work
- Tier progression functional
- No console errors

---

## What Worked Well ✅

1. **Risk System**: Quantity and fame modifiers create meaningful discovery chances
2. **Consequences**: Double karma loss on discovery makes ethical impact real
3. **Limited Stock**: Creates scarcity and strategic planning
4. **Regional Variants**: Adds geographic strategy
5. **Tier System**: Progression through missions adds long-term goals
6. **Transparency**: Clear risk calculation helps player planning

---

## Mod Configuration: READY ✅

Configuration files can be created in:
- `mods/core/economy/black_market_entries.toml` - Item definitions
- `mods/core/economy/black_market_dealers.toml` - Dealer definitions
- `mods/core/economy/black_market_config.toml` - System settings

**Example Black Market Items:**
- Alien plasma weapons (powerful, high karma cost)
- Banned explosives (restricted, high discovery risk)
- Stolen artifacts (valuable, political consequences)
- Black-market aliens (ethical nightmare, very high karma)
- Illegal research (quick tech, major relation hits)

---

## Post-Completion Notes

### System Flow
1. Player discovers dealer (mission or event)
2. Player browses black market items (filtered by region/level)
3. Player selects item and quantity
4. Risk is calculated and displayed
5. Player makes ethical choice (proceed or cancel)
6. Purchase reduces karma automatically
7. Discovery check rolls
8. If discovered: significant consequences
9. Item delivered secretly

### Integration Points
- Karma system: Automatic reduction on purchase
- Fame system: Discovery triggers loss
- Relations system: Consequences affect countries
- Finance system: Funding cuts apply
- Calendar system: Monthly inventory refresh

### Future Enhancements
- Negotiation with dealers
- Trust progression (higher levels = better items)
- Smuggling routes (reduce discovery chance)
- Underground network expansion
- Black market missions (gain stock, unlock levels)
- Political factions (different black markets)
- Counter-intelligence (detect player activities)
