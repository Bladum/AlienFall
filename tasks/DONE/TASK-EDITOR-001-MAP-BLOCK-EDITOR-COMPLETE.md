## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **MVC-Style:** Clear separation of Model (map grid), View (canvas render), Controller (input handlers)
- **Key Components:**
  - `MapEditor` - Core 425-line module with all editing logic
  - `HexRenderer` - Separate rendering system for hex grids (exists in `engine/battlescape/rendering/`)
  - `TilesetManager` - Loads and caches tilesets efficiently
  - `MapBlockLoader` - Handles TOML I/O

### Data Structures
- **Map Grid:** Lua table keyed by "x_y" coordinates
- **Undo/Redo:** History stack with 50-state limit
- **Metadata:** ID, name, group, tags, author, difficulty

### File Format (TOML Example)
```toml
[metadata]
id = "forest_01"
name = "Forest Camp"
description = "Forest terrain map block"
width = 15
height = 15
group = 0
tags = "forest,terrain"
author = "Level Designer"
difficulty = 1

[tiles]
"0_0" = "forest:grass_plain"
"1_0" = "forest:grass_forest"
...
```
