## Integration Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Combat UI Integration**: Wire weapon mode selector into combat interface
2. **Turn Manager Integration**: Hook all turn-based systems (regen, status effects, morale, throwables, reactions)
3. **AI Enhancements**: Implement AI behaviors for morale states, overwatch, sound detection
4. **Item Database**: Replace mock item data with real item system
5. **Visual Effects**: Add particle effects for grenades, status effects, environmental hazards

### Future Enhancements
1. **Ability Expansion**: Add more abilities per class (3-4 per class)
2. **Environmental Variety**: Add more hazard types (radiation, gas, ice)
3. **Advanced Sound**: Sound occlusion by walls, directional sound
4. **Inventory UI**: Visual inventory management screen
5. **Morale Modifiers**: Additional morale sources (terrain, weather, time of day)

### Testing Priorities
1. **Unit Tests**: Create test suite for each system
2. **Integration Tests**: Test system interactions (status effects + morale, throwables + hazards)
3. **Balance Testing**: Tune values for gameplay feel
4. **Performance**: Profile systems with large numbers of units

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current State
- All systems are **implementation complete** but **untested in live gameplay**
- Systems use **mock data** where real game systems don't exist yet (items, map data)
- **No visual effects** implemented yet (particles, animations)
- **AI behaviors** not implemented for new mechanics (morale states, sound detection)

### Integration Dependencies
- Requires integration with existing combat UI
- Requires turn manager hooks for turn-based processing
- Requires item database for inventory system
- Requires map tile data for environmental hazards
- Requires AI system for enemy behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Sound detection may need spatial optimization for large maps
- Status effects system scales linearly with effect count
- Throwables system needs optimization for many active grenades

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Focused Scope**: Breaking large systems into achievable 6-14 hour tasks
2. **Consistent Architecture**: Following established patterns made integration clear
3. **Configuration First**: Putting all constants at top made systems easy to tune
4. **Clear APIs**: Well-defined public functions simplify future integration
5. **Mock Data**: Using mock data allowed implementation without dependencies

### Process Improvements
1. **Better Planning**: Initial scope estimate was too large (140h+ tasks)
2. **Pivot Success**: Successfully pivoted to achievable tasks
3. **Sequential Implementation**: Completing tasks one-by-one maintained focus
4. **Documentation**: Detailed task documentation helped track progress

### Technical Insights
1. **State Management**: Per-unit state tracking is essential for all combat systems
2. **Turn-Based Processing**: Most systems need turn-end hooks
3. **Integration Points**: Clear hooks more important than immediate integration
4. **Nil Safety**: Always guard external data access (inventory system lesson)
