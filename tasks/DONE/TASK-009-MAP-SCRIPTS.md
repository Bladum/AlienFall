# TASK-009: Map Scripts and Generation

**Status:** DONE  
**Created:** October 15, 2025  
**Completed:** October 15, 2025  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Effort:** 11 hours

## Overview

Document map script system for procedural generation, mission map creation, and dynamic map assembly.

## Completed Work

✅ Reference materials created
- Map script architecture documented
- Generation algorithms documented
- Mission map system documented
- Procedural generation examples

## What Was Done

1. Extracted map generation information from system docs
2. Organized by generation type (static, procedural, mission)
3. Created example scripts
4. Provided integration guide

## Map Systems

### Static Maps
- Pre-designed Map Blocks
- Manual placement via editor
- Deterministic and balanced
- Used for: Base interiors, key locations

### Procedural Maps
- Algorithm-based generation
- Random seed support
- Deterministic with same seed
- Used for: Outdoor missions, alien bases

### Mission Maps
- Dynamically assembled for battles
- Mix of static and procedural
- Enemy placement system
- Victory conditions

## Script Types

```lua
-- Room template
local room = {
    blocks = {"urban_building_01", "office_floor"},
    connections = {{0, "north"}, {1, "south"}},
    exits = {"north", "south", "east"}
}

-- Procedural generator
local map = MapGenerator.generateOutdoor({
    width = 40,
    height = 30,
    density = "medium",
    terrain = "farmland",
    seed = 12345
})
```

## Generation Parameters

- Tile density (sparse/medium/dense)
- Terrain type (urban/farmland/alien)
- Difficulty modifier
- Objective placement
- Enemy count and types

## Testing

- ✅ Seed determinism verified
- ✅ Multiple generation algorithms working
- ✅ Mission map assembly validated
