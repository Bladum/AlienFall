# Narrative Hooks System - Implementation Complete

**Status:** DONE âœ…  
**Completed:** October 16, 2025

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive narrative hooks system for dynamic storytelling throughout the game campaign. Delivers lore, strategic information, and world events through gameplay triggers.

## System Architecture

### Core System (`engine/lore/narrative_hooks.lua`)
The `NarrativeHooks` class manages all narrative delivery in the game:
- 250+ lines of production code
- Event triggering based on game state
- Encyclopedia integration for discovered lore
- Narrative thread tracking
- Save/load persistence

**Key Components:**
1. **Event Loading** - Import narrative events from mod TOML files
2. **Event Triggering** - Fire narratives on game events
3. **Encyclopedia** - Discover and read lore entries
4. **Effect Application** - Modify game state on narrative events
5. **Narrative Tracking** - Track active story threads

### Content System (`mods/core/lore/narrative/narrative_events.toml`)
Comprehensive narrative content with 10+ core story beats including:
- Technology discoveries (Laser, Plasma, Power Armor research)
- Alien intelligence (Sectoid psychology, Ethereal threat, Muton analysis)
- Mission narratives (Terror mission success, UFO recovery)
- Campaign phases (First Contact, War Escalation)

## Hook Types

### 1. Research Completion Hooks
Triggered when player completes technology research

**Example:** `narrative_laser_research`
- Triggered by: `research_laser_weapons` completion
- Unlocks: Plasma research, Power research
- Effects: Funding +500, Panic -10, new research paths

### 2. Interrogation Hooks
Triggered after successfully interrogating captured aliens

**Example:** `narrative_sectoid_weakness`
- Triggered by: Sectoid interrogation
- Unlocks: Psionic defense research, Sectoid defection option
- Effects: Strategic intel revealed, new countermeasure options

### 3. Mission Outcome Hooks
Triggered on mission success or failure

**Example:** `narrative_terror_mission_success`
- Triggered by: Terror mission victory
- Effects: Funding +1000, Panic -25, morale boost
- Encyclopedia: Record heroic defense

### 4. Phase Transition Hooks
Triggered when entering new campaign phase

**Example:** `narrative_phase_one_start`
- Triggered by: Transition to Phase 1
- Effects: Panic +50, Funding +5000
- Narrative: World has learned about aliens

### 5. Diplomatic Hooks
Triggered by country relations and events

**Design:** Infrastructure for country/faction diplomatic events

### 6. Facility Completion Hooks
Triggered when player completes major facilities

**Example:** `narrative_base_established`
- Triggered by: Main base completion
- Effects: Strategic information unlocked
- Narrative: Base operational and functional

## TOML Structure

### Narrative Event Definition
```toml
[[narrative_hook]]

trigger_id = "id_of_triggering_element"  # research_id, alien_type, mission_id, phase_number, etc.
description = "Short description"
lore_entry = """
Multi-line lore text displayed to player.
Can contain multiple paragraphs.
Should be 2-4 sentences per line.
"""
encyclopedia_category = "technology|lore|factions|missions|campaign|operations"
priority = 50  # Higher = more important (0-100)
unlocks = ["other_narrative_id"]  # Other narratives this unlocks
effects = {
    unlock_research = ["research_id"],
    funding_change = 1000,
    panic_change = -10,
    strategic_intel = "description",
}
```

**Total:** 250 lines of Lua + 300+ lines of TOML content

## Usage Examples

### Loading Narrative Content
```lua
local NarrativeHooks = require("lore.narrative_hooks")
local narrative = NarrativeHooks:new()

-- Load from mod
local eventData = gameData.narrative_events
for id, data in pairs(eventData) do
    narrative:loadEvent(id, data)
end
```

### Triggering Narrative Events
```lua
-- Research completion triggers narrative
narrative:onResearchComplete("research_laser_weapons", gameState)

-- Interrogation triggers narrative
narrative:onInterrogation("sectoid_soldier", "Intelligence revealed", gameState)

-- Mission success
narrative:onMissionComplete("terror_mission_alpha", "success", gameState)

-- Phase transition
narrative:onPhaseTransition(2, gameState)
```

### Encyclopedia Access
```lua
-- Get all discovered lore
local entries = narrative:getEncyclopediaEntries()

-- Get entries by category
local tech = narrative:getEncyclopediaEntries("technology")
local lore = narrative:getEncyclopediaEntries("lore")

-- Check discovery count
local discovered = narrative:getDiscoveredCount()
```

### Checking Active Narratives
```lua
-- Check if narrative thread is active
if narrative:isNarrativeActive("narrative_ethereal_threat") then
    -- Player has discovered the Ethereal threat
    -- Can trigger new missions or options
end

-- Get all active narrative threads
local threads = narrative:getActiveNarrative()
```

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Revelation
- Players discover world lore through gameplay
- Information unlocked naturally by progression
- Narrative builds on previous discoveries
- Strategic information advances understanding

### Consequence Feedback
- Player actions have narrative consequences
- Mission outcomes trigger appropriate narratives
- Research discoveries drive story forward
- Intelligence gathering reveals threats and opportunities

### World Coherence
- Narrative explains game mechanics
- Lore entries provide context for content
- Strategic information affects player decisions
- Encyclopedia creates unified game world

## Future Development

### Additional Narrative Content
1. **Phase 2-3 narratives** - Advanced alien technology discovery
2. **Faction-specific narratives** - Each alien faction has story arc
3. **Country relationships** - Diplomatic narrative arcs
4. **Character narratives** - Individual soldier stories
5. **Base development** - Facility-specific story beats
6. **Research failures** - Negative narratives from failed research

### Enhanced Narrative System
1. **Branching narratives** - Player choices affect story
2. **Conditional narratives** - Different narratives based on difficulty/choices
3. **Narrative consequences** - Long-term effects of story choices
4. **Character progression** - Soldier stories and development
5. **Dynamic narrative** - Story adjusts based on player performance

### UI/Display Enhancements
1. **Notification system** - Non-intrusive narrative popups
2. **Encyclopedia UI** - Full browsable lore database
3. **Timeline view** - See game events chronologically
4. **Narrative replay** - Review discovered lore

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create narrative hooks system (Lua)
2. âœ… Create Phase 0-1 narrative content (TOML)
3. Integrate with UI for display
4. Create Phase 2-3 narrative content
5. Implement encyclopedia UI
6. Add branching narrative options
7. Create modding guide for custom narratives
8. Implement narrative consequences system
9. Add condition-based narrative variants
10. Create narrative testing suite

## Notes

All narrative follows consistent design:
- Clear cause-and-effect (trigger â†’ event)
- Meaningful effects on game state
- Encyclopedia integration for lore discovery
- Modifiable through TOML for easy expansion
- Support for complex narrative chains through unlocks

Narrative system is designed for:
- Complete moddability
- Easy narrative expansion
- Multiple languages/localization
- Performance optimization (lazy loading)
- Save/load persistence
