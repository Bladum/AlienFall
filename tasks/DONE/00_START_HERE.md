## üé≤ THREE BLOCKING DESIGN DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Pilot Stat Scale
**Question**: Should Piloting use 0-100 scale or 6-12 scale?

**Options**:
- **A**: Keep both (Pilots.md = 0-100, Units.md = 6-12)
  - Pro: Preserve both systems
  - Con: Massive contradiction, confusing for implementation

- **B**: Standardize on 6-12 (Pilots.md was outdated)
  - Pro: Consistent with all other stats
  - Con: Change Pilots.md
  - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**

- **C**: Standardize on 0-100 (redo stat system)
  - Pro: More granular
  - Con: Rewrite entire stat system
  - Con: Higher development cost

**Task File**: `CRITICAL_001_RESOLVE_PILOT_STAT_SCALE.md`

### Decision 2: Economy Balance
**Question**: How to fix the -164K monthly deficit?

**Current**:
- Income: 55-70K/month
- Expenses: 200-250K+/month
- Result: Game unplayable

**Options**:
- **A**: Increase Income
  - Pro: More missions, more salvage
  - Con: Easier gameplay

- **B**: Decrease Costs
  - Pro: More conservative
  - Con: Less facility building

- **C**: Hybrid (reduce some costs + add salvage)
  - Pro: Balanced approach
  - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**

**Task File**: `CRITICAL_002_FIX_ECONOMY_BALANCE.md`

### Decision 3: XP Progression Speed
**Question**: How fast should units level up?

**Options**:
- **A**: Fast (20-25 missions to max)
  - Pro: Quick specialization
  - Con: Less roster management

- **B**: Medium (50-75 missions to max)
  - Pro: Balanced engagement
  - Pro: Matches XCOM 2
  - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**

- **C**: Slow (100+ missions to max)
  - Pro: Deep specialization
  - Con: Risk of grinding fatigue

**Task File**: `CRITICAL_007_FIX_XP_PROGRESSION.md`

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FROM THIS AUDIT

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem 1**: Design files written at different times without reconciliation
- **Problem 2**: No central authority for stat definitions (contradiction)
- **Problem 3**: Economic model never tested for early-game viability
- **Problem 4**: Campaign progression speed never specified
- **Problem 5**: Trait system marked complete but unimplemented

### Prevention Going Forward
‚úÖ **Master Stat Table** - Single source of truth
‚úÖ **Design Decisions Log** - Track all choices
‚úÖ **Cross-reference validation** - Regular checks
‚úÖ **Specification templates** - Consistent format
‚úÖ **Designer reviews** - Before file commits

---

## üö® RISK AWARENESS

### Risk 1: Decisions delayed
**Mitigation**: Schedule decision meeting immediately
**Action**: Add to Day 1-2 agenda

### Risk 2: New contradictions discovered during H/M phases
**Mitigation**: Continue gap analysis pattern
**Action**: Keep gaps analysis document updated

### Risk 3: Effort estimates prove optimistic
**Mitigation**: 250-350 hour range accommodates variance
**Action**: Adjust after first 2 tasks complete

### Risk 4: High/Medium phase creates cascading revisions
**Mitigation**: Critical foundation is solid and tested
**Action**: Monitor for scope creep
