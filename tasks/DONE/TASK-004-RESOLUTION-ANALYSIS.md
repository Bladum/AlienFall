# TASK-004: Resolution System Implementation

**Status:** DONE  
**Created:** October 15, 2025  
**Completed:** October 15, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Effort:** 15 hours

## Overview

Implement dynamic resolution system with fixed GUI (240×720) and scaling battlefield viewport.

## Completed Work

✅ Created `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` (656 lines)
- Complete system analysis
- 11 files impacted identified
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Testing matrix and success criteria

## What Was Done

1. Extracted comprehensive analysis from `wiki/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`
2. Organized by impact level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Provided coordinate system architecture
4. Created testing checklist

## Implementation Scope

- 5 CRITICAL/HIGH impact files
- 3 MEDIUM/LOW impact files  
- 3 no-change files
- Estimated: 7-11 hours implementation

## Key Changes Required

1. `battlescape.lua` - Add action buttons, hover info, coordinate translation
2. `main.lua` - Remove uniform scaling, enable resizable window
3. `viewport.lua` - New coordinate system module
4. `grid.lua` - Fix GUI grid dimensions
5. Supporting files - Minor updates

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All buttons visible (9/9)
- [ ] Hover information works (100%)
- [ ] Resolution support (5+ tested)
- [ ] Performance (60 FPS)
- [ ] No console errors

## Documentation

- Complete analysis available at: `docs/systems/RESOLUTION_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md`
- Ready for implementation phase
