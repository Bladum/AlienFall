## Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- engine/economy/research/research_system.lua (380 lines)
- mods/core/research/technologies.toml (comprehensive tech tree)
- mods/core/research/items.toml (item analysis entries)
- mods/core/research/prisoners.toml (interrogation entries)

**Modified:**
- engine/core/data_loader.lua (+60 lines) - Added loadTechnology()
- engine/widgets/advanced/researchtree.lua - Tech tree visualization
- engine/scenes/basescape_screen.lua - Research UI integration
- engine/lore/narrative_hooks.lua - Research completion events

## Architecture

**Data Layer:**
- TOML files define all research entries
- Biome agnostic (same research tree for all locations)
- Support for tech tree dependencies

**Logic Layer:**
- ResearchSystem: Manages projects and completion
- TechTree: Validates and resolves dependencies
- Events: Broadcast research completion

**System Layer:**
- Calendar integration for daily updates
- Facility integration for capacity
- Event callbacks for unlocks

**UI Layer:**
- ResearchTree interactive visualization
- Project management interface
- Progress tracking displays

## Testing

**Unit Tests:**
- ✅ ResearchEntry loading from TOML
- ✅ Prerequisites validation
- ✅ Daily progression calculation
- ✅ Completion detection
- ✅ Unlock cascading

**Integration Tests:**
- ✅ Research progression with calendar system
- ✅ Lab capacity limiting scientists
- ✅ Unlocks affecting manufacturing
- ✅ Tech tree dependencies

**Manual Testing:**
- ✅ Start research in basescape
- ✅ Allocate scientists
- ✅ Advance calendar and see progress
- ✅ Complete research and verify unlocks
- ✅ Tech tree visualization works

## Performance

- Research lookup: O(1) via hash table
- Daily progression: O(n) where n = active projects
- Tech tree validation: O(v+e) where v=vertices, e=edges
- UI update: Only on changes, not every frame

## Documentation

- ✅ API.md updated with ResearchManager API
- ✅ FAQ.md updated with "How to research" guide
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md updated with architecture
- ✅ Code comments and docstrings throughout
- ✅ Function documentation with examples

## Known Limitations

1. Research is global (not per-base) - By design for simplicity
2. Tech tree is loaded at startup (no dynamic extension) - Can be enhanced
3. No custom tech tree editing UI - Can be added later
4. Random baseline is one-time per game (not per research entry)

## What Worked Well

- Clean separation between data (TOML) and logic (Lua)
- Event system allows extensible callback system
- Integration with existing DataLoader pattern
- Tech tree validation prevents invalid dependencies
- Simple prerequisite system scales well

## Lessons Learned

- TOML files are excellent for game content configuration
- Event-driven completion allows clean integration with other systems
- Tech tree as a data structure is simpler than complex script logic
- Global research simplifies implementation (can be enhanced to per-base later)

## How to Run/Debug

```bash
lovec "engine"
```

In-game testing:
1. Create base with laboratory
2. Hire scientists
3. Open Research screen (Basescape)
4. View tech tree
5. Start research on available entry
6. Assign scientists (10-20)
7. Advance calendar 1-30 days
8. Watch progress bar update
9. Research completes when progress = 100%
10. New research becomes available

Debug output (Love2D console):
```
[ResearchSystem] Started research 'Laser Weapons' with 12 scientists
[ResearchSystem] 'Laser Weapons' progress: 45/150 (+12)
[ResearchSystem] RESEARCH COMPLETE: Laser Weapons
[ResearchSystem] Unlocked: laser_rifle
```

## Alignment with Design Docs

- ✅ Matches docs/economy/research/framework.md design
- ✅ Follows XCOM-style research progression
- ✅ Tech tree structure matches design specs
- ✅ Daily progression mechanics correct
- ✅ Unlock system matches design

## Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

1. **Enhancement:** Per-base research capacity instead of global
2. **Enhancement:** Custom tech tree editing tool
3. **Enhancement:** Research speed modifiers (bonuses, penalties)
4. **Enhancement:** Research reports with lore content
5. **Enhancement:** Failed research with partial progress
6. **Bug Fixes:** None identified during testing
