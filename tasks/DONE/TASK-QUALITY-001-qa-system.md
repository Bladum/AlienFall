# Task: Code and Documentation Quality Assurance System

**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** High
**Created:** October 24, 2025
**Assigned To:** Development Team

---

## Overview

Build a comprehensive QA system that automatically checks code quality, documentation completeness, and best practice compliance. Generate detailed reports identifying violations, coverage gaps, and improvement opportunities.

---

## Purpose

Manual code review is inconsistent. A QA system provides:
- Consistent quality standards enforcement
- Automatic detection of violations
- Documentation completeness verification
- Code complexity analysis
- Performance issue detection
- Continuous quality tracking

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Code style validation (Lua standards)
- [x] Documentation completeness checks
- [x] Complexity analysis (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- [x] Performance issue detection
- [x] Security issue scanning
- [x] Test coverage tracking
- [x] Dependency analysis
- [x] Detailed QA reports

### Technical Requirements
- [x] Lua-based (no external dependencies)
- [x] File scanning and analysis
- [x] Metrics calculation
- [x] Report generation (HTML, JSON, text)
- [x] Integration with CI/CD
- [x] Configurable rule sets

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Scans all 293 engine files
- [x] Generates actionable reports
- [x] < 5 second scan time for full engine
- [x] Configuration files for rule sets
- [x] 30+ quality checks implemented
- [x] HTML reports for visibility

## Plan

### Phase 1-2: Analysis Engine & Style Checking (12 hours)
**Description:** Build core QA engine and implement code style checks
**Files to create/modify:**
- `tools/qa_system/qa_engine.lua` - Core QA system
- `tools/qa_system/style_checker.lua` - Code style validation
- `tools/qa_system/metrics_calculator.lua` - Metrics computation
- `tools/qa_system/file_scanner.lua` - File discovery and parsing

**Key checks:**
- Lua style compliance (snake_case, indentation, spacing)
- Global variable detection
- Nil/undefined reference checking
- Unused variable detection
- Function complexity metrics
- Code duplication detection

**Estimated time:** 12 hours

### Phase 3: Documentation & Complexity (10 hours)
**Description:** Implement documentation checks and complexity analysis
**Files to create/modify:**
- `tools/qa_system/documentation_checker.lua` - Docs validation
- `tools/qa_system/complexity_analyzer.lua` - Complexity metrics
- `tools/qa_system/dependency_analyzer.lua` - Dependency tracking

**Key checks:**
- Missing docstrings
- Incomplete function documentation
- Missing parameter documentation
- Cyclomatic complexity calculation
- Cognitive complexity estimation
- Dependency graph analysis
- Circular dependency detection

**Estimated time:** 10 hours

### Phase 4: Security & Performance (8 hours)
**Description:** Implement security and performance checks
**Files to create/modify:**
- `tools/qa_system/security_scanner.lua` - Security issues
- `tools/qa_system/performance_analyzer.lua` - Performance issues
- `tools/qa_system/memory_analyzer.lua` - Memory concerns

**Key checks:**
- Unsafe operations (no bounds checking)
- Performance anti-patterns (nested loops, excessive allocation)
- Memory leaks (unreleased objects)
- Deprecated API usage
- Known vulnerability patterns

**Estimated time:** 8 hours

### Phase 5-6: Reporting & Integration (10 hours)
**Description:** Implement reporting and CI/CD integration
**Files to create/modify:**
- `tools/qa_system/report_generator.lua` - Report generation
- `tools/qa_system/config.lua` - Rule configuration
- `tools/qa_system/runner.lua` - QA runner and CLI
- `docs/qa/QA_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Documentation

**Report types:**
- HTML report with interactive visualization
- JSON for tool integration
- Text summary for console output
- CVS report format

**Estimated time:** 10 hours

7. Trailing whitespace
8. Consistent string quoting

**Documentation (7 checks):**
9. Module has docstring
10. Functions have docstrings
11. Parameters documented
12. Return values documented
13. Complex logic has comments
14. Public API documented
15. Deprecated features marked

**Complexity (5 checks):**
16. Cyclomatic complexity (< 10 recommended)
17. Cognitive complexity (< 15 recommended)
18. Function length (< 100 LOC recommended)
19. Nesting depth (< 4 levels recommended)
20. Parameter count (< 5 recommended)

**Performance (6 checks):**
21. No nested loops over large collections
22. No excessive string concatenation
23. No repeated table lookups in loops
24. No excessive allocations
25. No inefficient sorting
26. No O(nÂ²) algorithms where O(n log n) available

## Testing Strategy

- Verify QA checks work correctly on test files
- Verify reports generate without errors
- Verify performance < 5 seconds
- Verify false positive rate < 5%

---

## Notes

- System is **non-intrusive** - doesn't modify code
- **Configurable** rules can be adjusted
- **Continuous** - can run on every commit
- **Reporting** - focuses on actionable insights
