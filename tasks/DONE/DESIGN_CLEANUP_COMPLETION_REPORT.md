## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risks Mitigated by This Work

**Risk 1**: Implementation starts before understanding design gaps
- âœ… **MITIGATED** - All 74 gaps now identified and documented

**Risk 2**: Developers guess at undefined mechanics
- âœ… **MITIGATED** - Comprehensive specifications provided

**Risk 3**: Design contradictions cause implementation delays
- âœ… **MITIGATED** - All contradictions identified and resolved

**Risk 4**: Team lacks agreed-upon progression speed/economy
- âœ… **MITIGATED** - Options with recommendations provided

**Risk 5**: No shared understanding of trait/stat systems
- âœ… **MITIGATED** - Complete specifications written

### Remaining Risks

**Risk 1**: Designers don't decide on pending questions
- **Mitigation**: Schedule decision meetings before implementation
- **Action**: Add to Week 1 agenda

**Risk 2**: High-priority tasks (H1-H11) create new blockers
- **Mitigation**: Review high-priority tasks in Week 3
- **Action**: Brief team that more cleanup may be needed

**Risk 3**: Effort estimates prove too conservative
- **Mitigation**: 250-350 hour estimate ranges widely
- **Action**: Adjust after completing first 2 critical tasks
