## Phase Progression

### Technology Availability
- **Phase 0**: Baseline human technology (no prerequisites)
- **Phase 1**: Requires Phase 0 research completion + alien artifact discovery
- **Phase 2**: Requires Phase 1 completion + extended alien study
- **Phase 3**: Requires Phase 2 completion + final alien research

### Research Trees

**Phase 0 → Phase 1:**
- Discovery of alien artifacts (automatic on UFO recovery)
- Laser Weapons research (unlocks energy weapons)
- Alien Biology research (leads to understanding)

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:**
- Plasma Weapons mastery
- Advanced Materials study
- Gauss Technology investigation

**Phase 2 → Phase 3:**
- Exotic physics research
- Dimensional phase studies
- Advanced alien technology integration

## Files Created

## Modding Support

Modders can:
1. Create new weapons by adding `[[weapon]]` sections
2. Create new armor types with special abilities
3. Define custom research chains with prerequisites
4. Create entirely new tech phases
5. Modify damage values and costs
6. Add new unit types with unique abilities

## Future Content

### Phase 2 Technology (In Development)
- Gauss Rifles (kinetic acceleration)
- Sonic Weapons (Sectoid tech)
- Aquatic operations (submarines)
- Advanced research facilities

### Phase 3 Technology (Planned)
- Particle Beam weapons
- Dimensional Phase tech
- Quantum systems
- Endgame units

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create Phase 0 content (TOML)
2. ✅ Create Phase 1 content (TOML)
3. Create Phase 2 content (gauss, sonic, aquatic)
4. Create Phase 3 content (particle, dimensional, exotic)
5. Create comprehensive research tree documentation
6. Integrate with existing research system
7. Create in-game tech tree UI
8. Add tech unlock notifications and lore entries
9. Create modding guide for custom weapons/armor
10. Implement tech point cost balancing

## Notes

All technology follows consistent design:
- Clear phase progression
- Research prerequisites create logical trees
- Balanced damage and cost relationships
- Special abilities differentiate late-game tech
- Easy for modders to extend and modify

Technology data is completely modifiable through TOML, enabling:
- Balance patches without code changes
- Community mod content creation
- Experimental tech trees
- Custom difficulty-based tech availability
