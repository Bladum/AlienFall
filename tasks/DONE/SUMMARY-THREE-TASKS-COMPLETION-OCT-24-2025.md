- PLUS: `tasks/DONE/TASK-EDITOR-002-WORLD-EDITOR-SKELETON-COMPLETE.md` (status report)

**Status:** Foundation In Place, Full Implementation Pending
**Completion:** 15% (Skeleton/Architecture Phase)
**Estimated Remaining:** 40+ hours (6 phases remaining)

### Skeleton Implementation
- ✅ Project structure created in `tools/world_editor/`
- ✅ Love2D configuration and launcher created
- ✅ Application main loop implemented
- ✅ Hexagonal grid visualization (90×45)
- ✅ Layer switching system (P/R/C/B keys)
- ✅ UI panel layouts (left, center, right)
- ✅ Zoom and pan controls
- ✅ Cursor highlighting

### Key Files Created
- `tools/world_editor/main.lua` (280 lines - skeleton)
- `tools/world_editor/conf.lua`
- `tools/world_editor/run_world_editor.bat`
- `tools/world_editor/README.md`

### Phases Remaining
1. Phase 2: Definition Manager (7 hours) - Load provinces, regions, countries, biomes
2. Phase 3: Tile Assignment (8 hours) - Assign entities to tiles
3. Phase 4: Layer Visualization (6 hours) - Color-coded layer display
4. Phase 5: Terrain Types (5 hours) - WATER, LAND, ROUGH, BLOCK
5. Phase 6: Import/Export (6 hours) - TOML save/load
6. Phase 7: Polish (5 hours) - Optimization and UI refinement
7. Phase 8: Testing (5 hours) - Comprehensive testing and docs

### Strategic Advantage
- **Leverages existing geoscape world system** - Engine already has `geoscape/world/` module
- **Clear roadmap** - 8-phase plan documented for next developer
- **Foundation solid** - All core infrastructure in place to add features
- **Similar to map editor** - Can reference map editor structure

### Next Steps for Continuation
```bash
# 1. Start with definition manager
vim tools/world_editor/src/definition_manager.lua

# 2. Create definition TOML files
mkdir -p mods/core/geoscape

# 3. Run editor to test
lovec "tools/world_editor"
```
