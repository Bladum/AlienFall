# Test Suite Reorganization & Phase Completion Report

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Phases 1-5 COMPLETE, 189 Tests Ready
**Progress:** 67% of target (189/282 tests)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully reorganized the `tests2/` folder structure from mixed layer/phase organization to a clean **by-type** structure. Completed implementation of Phase 4 (Compliance Tests) and Phase 5 (Security Tests), bringing the total test count from 105 to 189 tests.

**New Structure Benefits:**
- ✅ Easy to locate test types
- ✅ Run specific test categories independently
- ✅ Better CI/CD integration
- ✅ Clearer test coverage by type
- ✅ Scalable for future phases

## Implementation Notes

### Test Framework
All tests use the **HierarchicalSuite** framework with standard patterns:

```lua
local Suite = HierarchicalSuite:new({
    modulePath = "engine.core.system",
    fileName = "test_file.lua",
    description = "Test description"
})

Suite:group("Test Group", function()
    Suite:testMethod("System:method", {
        description = "What this tests",
        testCase = "category",
        type = "compliance|security|etc"
    }, function()
        Helpers.assertTrue(condition, "message")
    end)
end)
```

### Helper Assertions
All tests use helpers from `tests2.utils.test_helpers`:
- `assertTrue(condition, msg)`
- `assertFalse(condition, msg)`
- `assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)`
- `assertNotEqual(actual, expected, msg)`
- `assertNotNil(value, msg)`
- `assertNil(value, msg)`

### Test Naming Convention
- Module files: `*_compliance_test.lua`, `*_security_test.lua`
- Groups: Logical categories (e.g., "Game Rules", "Access Control")
- Methods: `System:method` format
