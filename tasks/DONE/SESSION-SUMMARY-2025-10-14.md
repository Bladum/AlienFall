## What Worked Well

1. **Existing Systems:** Many systems already existed and just needed verification/minor additions
2. **Data-Driven Design:** Adding weapons/items was straightforward via TOML
3. **Modular Architecture:** Each system is well-isolated and documented
4. **Testing:** Game runs successfully with console output for debugging

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (from Master Plan)
1. **TASK-031:** Map Generation System (bridges Geoscape â†’ Battlescape)
2. **TASK-026/027/028:** 3D Battlescape (3-phase, 85 hours total)
3. **TASK-029:** Basescape Facility System (base management)
4. **UI Integration:** Complete weapon modes UI integration

### Integration Needed
- Battle objectives need integration with mission spawning
- Weapon modes need UI for mode selection during combat
- Psionics need UI for ability selection

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check Existing Code First:** Many tasks were already partially complete
2. **Verification > Implementation:** Sometimes just verifying and documenting is enough
3. **Data-Driven Content:** Adding game content via TOML is fast and safe
4. **Incremental Testing:** Running game after each change catches issues early
5. **Task Organization:** Having tasks categorized helped prioritize work
