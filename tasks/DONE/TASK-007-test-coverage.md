## Implementation Details

### Test Structure
```lua
-- Test file template
local TestCase = {}

function TestCase.setup()
    -- Setup before each test
end

function TestCase.teardown()
    -- Cleanup after each test
end

function TestCase.test_description()
    -- Arrange
    local widget = Widget.new(0, 0, 96, 48)
    
    -- Act
    widget:update(0.016)
    
    -- Assert
    assert(widget.x == 0, "X position should be 0")
    assert(widget.y == 0, "Y position should be 0")
end

return TestCase
```

### Mock Data Strategy
Use `widgets.mock_data` for:
- Sample units
- Sample terrain
- Sample maps
- Sample items

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (Isolated)
- Test individual functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution
- No file I/O

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies
- May involve file I/O
- Test complete workflows

#### Performance Tests
- Measure execution time
- Check memory usage
- Compare against baselines
- Detect regressions

### Key Components

**Enhanced Test Runner:**
```lua
local TestRunner = {
    suites = {},
    results = {
        total = 0,
        passed = 0,
        failed = 0,
        skipped = 0,
        errors = {}
    },
    timing = {}
}

function TestRunner.runSuite(name, suite)
    -- Run all tests in suite
    -- Collect results
    -- Report findings
end

function TestRunner.generateReport()
    -- Output detailed results
    -- Save to temp directory
end
```

### Coverage Tracking
```lua
local Coverage = {
    files = {},
    lines = {}
}

function Coverage.track(file, line)
    -- Track which lines execute during tests
end

function Coverage.report()
    -- Calculate coverage percentage
    -- Generate report
end
```

### Dependencies
- Love2D testing framework
- Mock data generator
- Assertion library
- Test report generator

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid
- **70% Unit Tests:** Fast, isolated, many
- **20% Integration Tests:** Component interactions
- **10% E2E Tests:** Full workflows

### Critical Areas
- **Mod Loading:** Must work 100%
- **Battlescape Core:** High complexity
- **Widget System:** User-facing
- **LOS/Pathfinding:** Performance critical

### Test Data
- Use mock data for speed
- Create test fixtures
- Store test maps in `engine/tests/fixtures/`

### Continuous Testing
- Run tests before commits
- Run tests in CI pipeline
- Nightly performance tests
- Weekly full regression

## How to Run/Debug

### Running All Tests
```bash
lovec "engine" --test
# Or from menu: Tests â†’ Run All Tests
```

### Running Specific Suite
```lua
-- In tests_menu.lua
TestRunner.runSuite("widgets", require("widgets.tests.test_button"))
```

### Running Single Test
```lua
local test = require("widgets.tests.test_button")
test.test_button_creation()
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
- Check console for assertion failures
- Use `print()` in tests to trace execution
- Run single test in isolation
- Check mock data setup
- Verify test environment

### Console Output
```
[TestRunner] Starting test suite: widgets
[TestRunner] Running: test_button_creation... PASS (2ms)
[TestRunner] Running: test_button_click... PASS (1ms)
[TestRunner] Running: test_button_disabled... PASS (1ms)
[TestRunner] Suite widgets: 3/3 passed (4ms total)

=== Test Summary ===
Total: 45 tests
Passed: 43 (95.6%)
Failed: 2 (4.4%)
Skipped: 0
Time: 234ms
```
