## What Was Delivered

### Core Module: View3D
**File:** `engine/battlescape/rendering/view_3d.lua` (350 lines)

**Capabilities:**
- Camera state management (position, rotation, pitch)
- Hex-grid based camera rotation (W/A/S/D → 60° increments for N/NE/SE/S/SW/NW)
- Vertical pitch adjustment (Q/E → clamped -45° to +45°)
- Raycasting integration with HexRaycaster module
- Minimap rendering showing position and orientation
- Crosshair HUD at screen center
- Debug overlay with FPS, angle, hex coordinates
- Toggle logic for seamless 2D/3D switching

**Public API:**
```lua
View3D.new(battlescape_context)  -- Create new viewer
view3D:isEnabled()               -- Check if 3D mode active
view3D:toggleMode()              -- Switch between 2D and 3D
view3D:update(dt)                -- Update camera each frame
view3D:draw()                     -- Render 3D view
view3D:setCameraFromUnit(unit)   -- Position camera at unit
view3D:getWorldPosition()         -- Get current position
view3D:getDirection()             -- Get camera direction
```

### Integration Points
**File:** `engine/gui/scenes/battlescape_screen.lua` (5 changes)

1. **Requires:** Added View3D module import
2. **Initialize:** View3D created in enter() with battlescape context
3. **Input:** SPACE key handler in keypressed() for toggle
4. **Update:** view3D:update(dt) called each frame in update()
5. **Rendering:** Conditional draw() - 3D when enabled, 2D otherwise

## How It Works

**Architecture:**
```
Input → Battlescape Screen
  ├─ SPACE key → view3D:toggleMode()
  ├─ WASD keys → view3D camera rotation (handled in view3D:update)
  └─ UI events → existing 2D systems

Update Loop:
  └─ view3D:update(dt)  [updates camera angle, pitch]

Rendering:
  ├─ if view3D:isEnabled()
  │  └─ view3D:draw()  [raycasting, HUD, debug info]
  └─ else
     └─ existing 2D rendering
```

**2D Mode (Default):**
- All existing tactical controls work
- Top-down grid view
- Unit selection, movement, etc.

**3D Mode (SPACE toggle):**
- First-person camera view
- WASD rotates camera (N/NE/SE/S/SW/NW)
- Q/E adjusts pitch
- Minimap shows position
- Crosshair for aiming
- Press SPACE to return to 2D
