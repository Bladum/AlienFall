## What Was Delivered (Phase 1)

### Core Module: EffectsRenderer
**File:** `engine/battlescape/rendering/effects_renderer.lua` (550+ lines)

**Capabilities:**
- 4-frame fire animation (hot → bright → medium → dim)
- Smoke effect with fade animation (visible → fading → gone)
- Explosion effect with burst animation (initial → center → spread → end)
- Object rendering (walls, obstacles, terrain features)
- Distance-based rendering priority
- Z-sorting for proper layering
- Animation frame management
- Performance-optimized rendering
- Fallback colored rectangles if no sprite

**Public API:**
```lua
EffectsRenderer.new(view3d_context)                    -- Create new renderer
renderer:addFire(position, intensity, duration)       -- Add fire effect
renderer:addSmoke(position, radius, duration)         -- Add smoke effect
renderer:addExplosion(position, radius)               -- Add explosion effect
renderer:addObject(object_type, position, rotation)   -- Add wall/obstacle
renderer:update(dt)                                   -- Update animations
renderer:sortEffects()                                -- Apply Z-sorting
renderer:draw()                                       -- Render all effects
renderer:clear()                                      -- Reset each frame
renderer:getEffectAtPosition(x, y)                    -- Query effects
```

### View3D Integration
**File:** `engine/battlescape/rendering/view_3d.lua` (4 changes)

1. **Requires:** Added EffectsRenderer import
2. **Initialize:** EffectsRenderer created in View3D:new()
3. **Update:** renderer:update(dt) called each frame
4. **Rendering:** renderer:draw() called during 3D draw pass

## Architecture

**Effects Rendering Pipeline:**
```
View3D:draw()
  ├─ renderer:update(dt)           [update animation timers]
  ├─ [Add effects and objects]
  ├─ renderer:sortEffects()        [Z-sort by distance]
  ├─ renderer:draw()               [render sorted queue]
  │  ├─ for each effect:
  │  │  ├─ project3DToScreen()     [3D→2D conversion]
  │  │  ├─ animate effect          [update frame]
  │  │  ├─ draw sprite/particle    [render effect]
  │  │  └─ apply opacity/color     [color adjustments]
  │  ├─ for each object:
  │  │  ├─ apply team color        [object coloring]
  │  │  └─ draw sprite/rectangle   [render object]
  │  └─ renderer:clear()           [reset for next frame]
```

**Animation System:**
```lua
-- Time-based animation with frame tracking
-- Each effect has: duration, frame count, current time
-- Handles frame transitions and cleanup
-- Supports variable frame counts per effect type
```

**Effect Types:**

**1. Fire Animation (4 frames, ~500ms):**
- Frame 1: Hot phase (bright orange)
- Frame 2: Bright phase (yellow-white)
- Frame 3: Medium phase (orange)
- Frame 4: Dim phase (red-orange)
- Loop or fade based on duration

**2. Smoke Animation (3 frames, ~1000ms fade):**
- Frame 1: Visible smoke (opacity 1.0)
- Frame 2: Fading smoke (opacity 0.5)
- Frame 3: Nearly gone (opacity 0.1)
- Cleanup when animation complete

**3. Explosion Animation (4 frames, ~400ms burst):**
- Frame 1: Initial burst (center)
- Frame 2: Expanding (medium radius)
- Frame 3: Maximum spread (large radius)
- Frame 4: Fading (reduced opacity)
- Cleanup after animation

**4. Objects (Static/Animated):**
- Walls, obstacles, terrain features
- Can have rotation (for diagonal walls)
- Distance-based rendering
- Optional team color coding

## How It Works

**Effect Rendering Pipeline:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - EffectsRenderer created in View3D
   - Animation timers initialized
   - Effect queue ready
   - Object registry prepared

2. **Each Frame (update):**
   - Update all animation timers
   - Remove expired effects
   - Add new effects (from combat system)
   - Add new objects (from terrain system)
   - Sort by distance (Z-sort)
   - Render all effects/objects
   - Clear queue for next frame

3. **Animation Update (per effect):**
   - Increment elapsed time by dt
   - Calculate current frame based on time
   - Check for animation completion
   - Mark for removal if done
   - Otherwise continue animation

4. **Rendering (per effect):**
   - Project 3D position to 2D screen
   - Determine current animation frame
   - Load/cache sprite for frame
   - Apply opacity adjustments (fog/LOS)
   - Draw sprite/rectangle
   - Apply color effects (fire glow, smoke gray)
