## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Verification First:** Checking existing systems before implementing saved ~60 hours
2. **Modular Design:** Each system is self-contained and easily testable
3. **Clear APIs:** Functions have clear parameters and return values
4. **Default Data:** Including default projects makes systems immediately testable
5. **Integration Points:** Designed systems to work together (research → manufacturing)

### Challenges
1. **Master Plan Scope:** TASK-016 has 200+ hours of features; implemented subset
2. **Task Document Accuracy:** Some task files have wrong numbers (TASK-026 file issue)
3. **System Dependencies:** Manufacturing depends on research, need to verify loading order

### Improvements
1. **More Testing:** Should create test files for each new system
2. **UI Planning:** Should plan UI integration before implementing backend
3. **Task Document Cleanup:** Reorganize TODO folders to match actual task numbers
