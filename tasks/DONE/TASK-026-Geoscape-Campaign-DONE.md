**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Created:** October 13, 2025  
**Completed:** October 16, 2025  
**Assigned To:** AI Agent

## Summary

Geoscape Lore & Campaign System has been implemented with comprehensive mission generation, faction management, and dynamic escalation. The system generates 2-10 missions per month that escalate over a 2-year campaign, creating dynamic strategic gameplay.

## Implementation Status

- CampaignManager:init() - Initialize campaign system
- :advanceDay() - Progress game time by 1 day
- :generateWeeklyMissions() - Spawn missions every Monday
- :updateMissions() - Update active mission states
- :getMissions(provinceId) - Query missions in province
- :getCurrentDay/Week/Month/Year() - Get current time
- :serialize() / deserialize() - Save/load campaign state

**3. Mission System (engine/lore/missions/mission_system.lua)**
- Mission base class with polymorphic types

- Mission scoring for unhandled threats

**4. Mission Types Implementation**
- **MissionSite:** Static missions in province, waiting for interception
  - Expires after 7 days if not handled
  - Rewards items/credits
  - Player gets scoring penalty if ignored
  
- **MissionUFO:** Mobile UFOs with movement scripts
  - Follow daily movement patterns between provinces
  - Can land (become stationary) or takeoff
  - Exit map after patrol complete
  
- **MissionBase:** Permanent alien bases
  - Grow over time (weekly level increases)
  - Spawn missions from base
  - Can be destroyed by player attack

**5. Campaign Generation (engine/lore/campaign/campaign_system.lua)**
- Campaign structure with mission templates
- Escalation formula: 2 missions/month → 10 missions/month over 2 years
- Faction assignment per campaign
- Weekly mission spawning from active campaigns
- Campaign disabling via research completion

**6. Quest System (engine/lore/quests/quest_system.lua)**
- Quest definitions with conditions and rewards
- Condition tracking and evaluation
- Quest completion detection
- Reward/penalty application
- Quest failure timeout handling
- Types: Kill X enemies, research tech, build facilities, complete missions

**7. Event System (engine/lore/events/event_system.lua)**
- Random monthly event generation (3-5 events/month)
- Event types: Resource changes, money, relations, mission spawning
- Event conditions and triggers
- Event impact on game state
- Narrative integration with story events

**8. Script Systems**
- **UFO Scripts:** Daily movement logic
  - Move between provinces
  - Land and takeoff
  - Patrol patterns
  - Exit map after completion
  
- **Base Scripts:** Weekly growth logic
  - Increase base level
  - Unlock new mission types
  - Spawn new missions
  
- **Campaign Scripts:** Mission spawning logic
  - Sequential mission generation
  - Random mission selection
  - Delay-based spawning

**Modified:**

- engine/geoscape/init.lua - Campaign manager integration
- engine/main.lua - Campaign loop integration

## Architecture

**Campaign Loop:**
- Every day: Update missions, trigger events
- Every Monday: Generate weekly missions
- Every month: Random event generation
- Every quarter: Escalation check (increase mission count)
- Every tech complete: Check for campaign disabling

**Mission Lifecycle:**
- **Site:** Spawned (hidden) → Detected (radar) → Intercepted (combat) → Completed/Expired
- **UFO:** Spawned (hidden) → Detected (radar) → Intercepted (combat) → Exited
- **Base:** Spawned → Growing (weekly upgrades) → Spawns missions → Destroyed

**Data Structure:**
- Faction definitions in TOML with lore, units, tech tree
- Campaign templates per faction
- Mission templates with rewards and requirements
- Quest definitions with conditions and triggers
- Event definitions with probabilities

## Testing

**Unit Tests:**
- ✅ Campaign generation formula
- ✅ Mission type spawning
- ✅ Escalation calculation
- ✅ Quest condition evaluation
- ✅ Event triggering

**Integration Tests:**
- ✅ Campaign progresses over time
- ✅ Missions spawn weekly
- ✅ UFOs move daily
- ✅ Bases grow weekly
- ✅ Events trigger monthly
- ✅ Research disables campaigns
- ✅ Relations affect frequency

**Manual Testing:**
- ✅ Start new game
- ✅ Observe mission generation on Monday
- ✅ Watch escalation over game quarters
- ✅ Advance time and see events
- ✅ Complete research and disable faction campaigns

## Performance

- Campaign manager update: O(n) where n = active missions (~100)
- Mission generation: O(1) per mission
- Event triggering: O(1)
- Faction lookup: O(1) via hash table

## Documentation

- ✅ API.md updated with CampaignManager API
- ✅ FAQ.md updated with "Campaign progression" guide
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md updated with architecture
- ✅ Lore documentation with faction descriptions

## Known Limitations

1. Escalation is hardcoded (could be configurable)
2. Mission variety depends on content availability
3. No visual campaign map (can be added)
4. No custom campaign modification UI

## What Worked Well

- TOML-based faction and mission definitions
- Extensible quest/event systems
- Clean mission type polymorphism
- Script engine for UFO/Base behavior
- Calendar integration clean

## Lessons Learned

- Polymorphic mission types (Site/UFO/Base) well-designed
- Script-based movement/growth simple and flexible
- Event system elegantly handles randomness

## How to Run/Debug

```bash
lovec "engine"
```

In-game testing:
1. Start new game (Day 1)
2. Observe initial mission generation
3. Advance calendar to Monday (Day 8)
4. Watch new missions spawn
5. Continue to Month 2, Quarter 2
6. See escalation (more missions per month)
7. Complete faction research
8. Verify campaigns for faction disabled

Debug output (Love2D console):
```
[Campaign] === Day 1 (Week 1, Month 1, Year 1) ===
[Campaign] 2 mission(s) spawned this week
[Campaign] UFO mission started: Sectoid Patrol
[Campaign] Active missions: 2, Completed: 0, Expired: 0
```

## Alignment with Design Docs

- ✅ Matches docs/geoscape/campaign.md design
- ✅ Mission types correct (Site/UFO/Base)
- ✅ Escalation formula matches specs
- ✅ Faction system matches lore docs
- ✅ Quest/event systems as designed

## Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

1. **Enhancement:** Visual campaign map display
2. **Enhancement:** Custom campaign scripts
3. **Enhancement:** Campaign difficulty presets
4. **Enhancement:** Dynamic mission rewards
5. **Bug Fixes:** None identified
