- ✅ Projectile System
- ✅ Damage Resolution System  
- ✅ Explosion System
- ✅ Pathfinding System
- **Total:** 4 tasks, ~2,174 lines, 79 hours estimated

**Batch 2 (Current - Core Modules Complete):**

- ✅ Weapon Modes System (40% done)
- ✅ Psionics System (40% done)
- ✅ Enhanced Critical Hits (Core done)

---

## New Systems Implemented

### 1. Damage Models System (TASK-017) ✅ 60%

**Status:** Core module complete, integration pending  
**File Created:** `engine/battlescape/combat/damage_models.lua` (225 lines)

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Four damage models fully defined
- ✅ STUN model: 100% stun, recovers 2/turn, non-lethal
- ✅ HURT model: 75% health + 25% stun, can kill
- ✅ MORALE model: 100% morale, recovers 5/turn, causes panic
- ✅ ENERGY model: 80% energy + 20% stun, recovers 3/turn
- ✅ Distribution calculation functions
- ✅ Recovery rate system
- ✅ Morale impact severity levels
- ✅ Terminology fix in projectile.lua
- ✅ Integration with damage_system.lua

**What's Remaining:**
- ⏳ Recovery system in turn manager (3h)
- ⏳ Update weapon data files (2h)
- ⏳ UI display for models (2h)
- ⏳ Testing (2h)
**Remaining:** 9 hours

**Key Innovation:**
Separates damage METHOD (point/area) from damage TYPE (kinetic/laser) from damage MODEL (how it distributes). Each model has unique recovery mechanics, making damage choices strategically important.

---

### 2. Weapon Modes System (TASK-018) ✅ 40%

**Status:** Core module complete, integration pending  
**File Created:** `engine/battlescape/combat/weapon_modes.lua` (369 lines)

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Six weapon modes fully defined with modifiers
- ✅ SNAP: 50% AP, 70% accuracy, 50% EP (quick reactions)
- ✅ AIM: 100% AP, 130% accuracy, 100% EP (balanced)
- ✅ LONG: 150% AP, 150% accuracy, 150% range (sniper)
- ✅ AUTO: 200% AP, 60% accuracy/bullet, 5 bullets, 250% EP (burst)
- ✅ HEAVY: 250% AP, 150% damage, 300% EP, +10% crit (anti-armor)
- ✅ FINESSE: 120% AP, 70% damage, 180% accuracy, +15% crit (precision)
- ✅ Mode modifier application function
- ✅ Validation and requirement checking
- ✅ Range and ammo enforcement

**What's Remaining:**
- ⏳ Shooting system integration (4h)
- ⏳ Mode selection UI (6h)
- ⏳ Weapon data updates (2h)
- ⏳ Recoil system (4h)
- ⏳ Visual feedback (3h)
- ⏳ Testing (3h)
**Remaining:** 22 hours

**Key Innovation:**
Unlike X-COM UFO where each weapon has custom shot types, this uses COMMON modifiers that work universally. Makes balancing easier and provides consistent tactical choices across all weapons.

### 3. Psionics System (TASK-019) ✅ 40%

**Status:** Framework complete, ability execution pending  
**File Created:** `engine/battlescape/combat/psionics_system.lua` (594 lines)

**What's Done:**
- ✅ 11 psionic abilities fully defined
- ✅ PSI DAMAGE: Mental attack with selectable damage model
- ✅ PSI CRITICAL: Guaranteed crit + 25% damage boost
- ✅ DAMAGE TERRAIN: Destroy obstacles (50 power, 2 hex radius)
- ✅ UNCOVER TERRAIN: Reveal fog (5 hex radius, 3 turns)
- ✅ MOVE TERRAIN: Telekinesis on tiles (3 tile move range)
- ✅ CREATE FIRE: Pyrokinesis (intensity 3, spreads)
- ✅ CREATE SMOKE: Smoke generation (3 hex radius)
- ✅ MOVE OBJECT: Telekinesis on objects (50kg, throw as weapon)
- ✅ MIND CONTROL: Dominate enemy (3 turns, resistible)
- ✅ SLOW UNIT: -2 AP debuff (2 turns)
- ✅ HASTE UNIT: +2 AP buff (2 turns)
- ✅ Cost system (AP, EP, psi energy)
- ✅ Range and LOS requirements
- ✅ Skill level requirements
- ✅ Validation framework
- ✅ Execution framework (stubs)

**What's Remaining:**

- ⏳ Psi amp equipment (3h)
- ⏳ Psi ability UI (8h)
- ⏳ Visual effects (6h)
- ⏳ Psi skill progression (4h)
- ⏳ Testing (5h)
**Remaining:** 52 hours

**Key Innovation:**
Comprehensive mental powers system that provides ALTERNATIVES to combat, not just different damage types. Mind control, terrain manipulation, and tactical buffs create entirely new strategic possibilities.

---

### 4. Enhanced Critical Hit System (TASK-020) ✅ Core Complete

**Status:** Core logic done, data and UI pending  
**File Modified:** `engine/battlescape/combat/damage_system.lua`

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Base 5% crit + weapon + class system
- ✅ `rollCriticalHit(weapon, attacker)` function complete
- ✅ Calculates: base + weapon.critChance + attacker.critBonus
- ✅ Proper debug logging
- ✅ Integrated with damage resolution

**What's Remaining:**
- ⏳ Weapon crit data (2h)
- ⏳ Unit class crit bonuses (2h)
- ⏳ Enhanced wound tracking (2h)
- ⏳ Wound display UI (3h)
- ⏳ Bleeding combat log (2h)
- ⏳ Optional medical treatment (4h)
- ⏳ Testing (2h)
**Remaining:** 13-17 hours

**Key Innovation:**
Makes critical hits BUILDABLE. Players can create precision-focused builds with:
- Sniper Rifle (+15%) + Assassin Class (+10%) + FINESSE mode (+15%) = 45% crit chance
- Wounds stack: 3 wounds = 3 HP/turn bleed = death in ~3 turns for 10 HP units
- Creates high-risk damage-over-time mechanic

4. Test model combinations with different weapons

### Weapon Modes
1. Test each mode with rifle (base stats)
2. Verify AP costs match modifiers
3. Test AUTO mode fires 5 bullets
4. Verify range restrictions (LONG min 3 tiles)
5. Test mode availability per weapon
6. Verify FINESSE crit bonus stacks

### Psionics
1. Test each ability with valid target
2. Verify psi energy consumption
3. Test range and LOS requirements
4. Test mind control duration and break conditions
5. Verify slow/haste AP modifications
6. Test fire/smoke creation

### Critical Hits

## How These Systems Work Together

### Combat Flow Example

1. **Select Weapon Mode:**
   - Choose FINESSE for precision (+180% accuracy, +15% crit)

2. **Target Enemy:**
   - Roll to hit with boosted accuracy
   - Roll critical hit: base 5% + weapon 15% + class 10% + mode 15% = 45%

3. **Critical Hit:**
   - Deals +50% damage
   - Applies 1 wound → 1 HP/turn bleeding

4. **Damage Resolution:**
   - Apply armor resistance (damage type: kinetic/laser/etc)
   - Subtract armor value
   - Distribute using damage model (HURT: 75% health, 25% stun)

5. **Secondary Effects:**
   - Morale loss from taking damage
   - Bleeding starts next turn
   - Unit may panic from morale loss

6. **Psionic Follow-Up:**
   - Use PSI DAMAGE (morale model) to force panic
   - Or use SLOW to reduce their AP by 2
   - Or use MIND CONTROL to turn them against allies

7. **Environmental Control:**
   - CREATE SMOKE to deny vision
   - CREATE FIRE to block paths
   - DAMAGE TERRAIN to destroy cover

**Result:** Deep, interconnected tactical system with many strategic options.
