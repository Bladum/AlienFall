## Content Structure

### Faction Definition
```lua
{
  id = "insectoids",
  name = "Insectoid Collective",
  units = {"worker", "soldier", "queen"},
  tech_tree = "insectoid_biotech",
  relations = {human = -70, sectoid = 20},
  traits = {"hive_mind", "fast_reproduction"},
  stats = {aggression = 8, intelligence = 7},
  unit_composition = {worker = 0.4, soldier = 0.5, queen = 0.1},
}
```

### Mission Template
```lua
{
  id = "alien_harvesting",
  name = "Alien Harvesting Operation",
  type = "combat",
  difficulty = 3,
  objectives = {"eliminate_aliens", "protect_civilians"},
  enemy_count_range = {min = 8, max = 12},
  rewards = {experience = 300, science = 200, money = 1500},
  probability = 0.15,
}
```

### Campaign Event
```lua
{
  id = "research_breakthrough",
  name = "Research Breakthrough",
  event_type = "positive",
  category = "research",
  effects = {
    {type = "tech_unlock", tech_id = "psionic_basics"},
    {type = "morale_boost", value = 10},
  },
  trigger_conditions = {research_points_min = 1000},
  probability = 0.08,
}
```

## How to Use

### Load Content
```lua
local ContentLoader = require("engine.content.content_loader")
local content = ContentLoader.loadAll()
```

### Access Factions
```lua
local insectoid = content.factions.insectoids
print("Faction: " .. insectoid.name)
print("Units: " .. table.concat(insectoid.units, ", "))
```

### Access Missions
```lua
local mission = content.missions.alien_harvesting
print("Mission: " .. mission.name)
print("Difficulty: " .. mission.difficulty)
```

### Access Events
```lua
for id, event in pairs(content.events) do
  print("Event: " .. event.name .. " (" .. event.probability .. "%)")
end
```

## Current Statistics

| Metric | Value |

## Integration Points

### Campaign System
```lua
-- Select random mission
local mission = campaign:selectMission()

-- Get faction info
local faction = campaign:getFaction("insectoids")

-- Trigger event
campaign:triggerEvent("research_breakthrough")
```

### Mission Generator
```lua
-- Generate varied mission
local mission = MissionGenerator.generate({
  template_id = "alien_harvesting",
  difficulty_modifier = 1.2,
})
```

### Event Manager
```lua
-- Queue event
EventManager.queue("economic_crisis", 0.05)

-- Apply effects
event:apply(campaign)
```

## Quality Metrics

### Faction Balance
- Aggression range: 4-10
- Intelligence range: 4-10
- Diplomatic spread: -70 to +30

### Mission Difficulty
- Range: 1-10
- Scaling: 1-2 (easy), 3-5 (medium), 6-8 (hard), 9-10 (legendary)
- Rewards scale with difficulty

### Event Probability
- Positive: 8-20% per turn
- Negative: 5-15% per turn
- Rare: 1-3% per turn

## Next Steps

1. Create 4 additional alien factions
2. Design 18 more mission templates
3. Create 27 additional events
4. Implement event chain system
5. Build mission generator
6. Test and balance content

## Notes

- Framework is **modular** and extensible
- **Easy to add content** without code changes
- **Performance-optimized** with lazy loading
- **Well-documented** with examples
- **Type-safe** with validation
