**Estimated:** 60 hours

**Summary:**
Created turn-based interception mini-game for craft vs UFO combat with altitude layering.

**Files Created:**
- `interception/logic/interception_screen.lua` - 380 lines

**Key Features:**
- **3 Altitude Layers:**
  - AIR: Aircraft and aerial UFOs
  - LAND: Ground units, landed UFOs, surface sites
  - UNDERGROUND/UNDERWATER: Subterranean bases, underwater sites
- **Two-Sided Combat:**
  - Player units: Crafts (Interceptor, Fighter, etc.) + Base Facilities (for base defense)
  - Enemy units: UFOs (Scout, Fighter, Battleship), Alien Sites, Alien Bases
- **Turn-Based Mechanics:**
  - 1 turn = 5 minutes game time
  - All units get 4 AP per turn
  - Player phase → Enemy phase → Repeat
- **Action Point System:**
  - Each unit has 4 AP per turn
  - Weapons cost AP to use (1-4 AP typical)
  - Units can act multiple times per turn if AP available
- **Energy System:**
  - Each unit has energy pool (100 typical)
  - Weapons cost energy to fire
  - Energy recovers 10 per turn
  - Out of energy = cannot use energy weapons
- **Weapon System:**
  - AP cost: Action points to fire
  - Energy cost: Energy consumed per shot
  - Cooldown: Turns before weapon can fire again
  - Damage: Base damage dealt
  - Target altitudes: Restrictions on what can be targeted
    - Example: AIR-to-AIR weapon cannot target LAND
    - Example: Surface-to-Air missile cannot target UNDERGROUND
- **Combat Resolution:**
  - Damage calculation: baseDamage - armor
  - Health tracking per unit
  - Status changes: ACTIVE → DAMAGED (30% HP) → DESTROYED (0 HP)
- **Simple AI:**
  - Enemy units attack first available player unit
  - Uses first available weapon
  - No movement (units stay in altitude layer)
- **Win/Loss/Retreat:**
  - Victory: All enemy units destroyed
  - Defeat: All player units destroyed
  - Retreat: Player voluntarily disengages (all units marked RETREATED)
- **Combat Logging:**
  - Every action logged with turn number
  - Attack results (damage dealt, armor reduction)
  - Unit destruction notifications
  - Turn start/end markers
- **Base Defense Integration:**
  - Base facilities can participate as defensive units
  - Example: Defense System facility acts as ground-based weapon platform
  - Altitude: LAND

**Example Combat Flow:**
```
Turn 1 - Player Phase:
  - Interceptor attacks UFO Scout with Cannon (2 AP, 20 energy)
  - 50 damage - 10 armor = 40 damage dealt
  - Interceptor attacks again with Missile (3 AP, 30 energy)
  - 100 damage - 10 armor = 90 damage dealt
  - UFO Scout DESTROYED

Turn 1 - Enemy Phase:
  - UFO Battleship attacks Interceptor with Plasma Beam (2 AP, 40 energy)
  - 80 damage - 20 armor = 60 damage dealt
  - Interceptor DAMAGED (40/100 HP)

Turn 2 - Player Phase:
  - Interceptor retreats...
```

**Future Enhancements:**
- Multiple crafts coordinating attacks
- Craft abilities (evasive maneuvers, shields)
- Environmental effects (storms reduce accuracy)
- Formation positioning within altitude layer

  - Ray marches in 0.1 tile steps
  - Detects wall hits
  - Calculates distance to hit
  - Renders vertical wall slice at screen X
  - Wall height = screenHeight / (distance × 2)
- **Hex-Aware Raycasting:**
  - Integrates with hex tile system (not square grid)
  - Ray checks hex tiles for blocking terrain
  - Distance calculation respects hex geometry
- **Distance Fog:**
  - Fog start: 8 tiles (full brightness)
  - Fog end: 15 tiles (minimum brightness 0.1)
  - Linear falloff between start and end
  - Darkens colors: color × fogFactor

- Rendering order: Sky → Floor → Walls → Units (future) → UI
- No anti-aliasing (preserves crisp pixel art)
- No real-time game state changes (turn-based)
- Zero impact on 2D mode performance

**Future Phases:**
- **Phase 2: Textures & Units**
  - Texture mapping with 24×24 pixel assets

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Modular Design:** Each system is self-contained and independently testable
2. **Clear APIs:** Functions have well-defined inputs and outputs
3. **Default Data:** Including test data makes systems immediately usable
4. **Integration Points:** Systems designed to work together from the start
5. **Status Tracking:** Clear state management (empty, construction, operational, damaged)
6. **Validation:** Built-in checks prevent invalid states

### Challenges
1. **Task Numbering:** Multiple tasks with same number (TASK-029) - need better organization
2. **UI Integration:** Backend systems complete but need UI layers
3. **Testing Coverage:** Need comprehensive test cases for each system
4. **Performance:** 3D raycasting needs optimization for larger maps

### Improvements
1. **More Granular Tasks:** Break large systems into smaller sub-tasks
2. **Test-Driven:** Write tests before implementation
3. **UI Planning:** Design UI mockups before backend
4. **Performance Profiling:** Measure and optimize early
