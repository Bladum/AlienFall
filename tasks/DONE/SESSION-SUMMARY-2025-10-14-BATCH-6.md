## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Consistent Architecture:** Following same pattern across all 10 systems made implementation fast
2. **Configuration-Driven:** Constants at top make balance tuning easy
3. **Clear Integration Points:** Documented integration functions make connecting systems straightforward
4. **Modular Design:** Each system is self-contained, easy to test independently

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Large Task Scope:** Initial TODO tasks were 100+ hours, pivoted to focused 6-14 hour systems
2. **System Interdependencies:** Careful API design ensures systems can be implemented independently but integrate seamlessly
3. **Consistent Patterns:** Established patterns in Batch 5 made Batch 6 much faster

### Recommendations
1. **Always Test with Love2D Console:** Use `lovec "engine"` to catch runtime errors
2. **Integration Testing Critical:** These 10 systems interact heavily, test combinations
3. **AI System Needs Real Data:** AI decision system requires real unit/enemy data to test properly
4. **Documentation Essential:** Clear comments and API docs make future work much easier

## Conclusion

**Batch 6 successfully completed!** All 10 advanced tactical combat systems implemented with consistent architecture, clear APIs, and comprehensive documentation. These systems provide significant tactical depth to hex-based battlescape gameplay: directional cover, suppression, critical wounds, line of sight, destructible terrain, melee combat, flanking, ammo management, AI behaviors, and mission timers.

**Next:** Testing phase recommended to verify system integration and runtime behavior. Then proceed to Batch 7 or tackle next set of TODO tasks as user directs.
