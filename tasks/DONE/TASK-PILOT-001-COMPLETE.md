**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Duration:** 4-5 hours (Verified work already done)

## What Was Done

### Summary
Verified and integrated the PILOT class system which was already implemented in TOML configuration. Fixed the DataLoader to properly load unit classes from TOML.

### Changes Made

**1. DataLoader Fix - `engine/core/data_loader.lua`**
- Fixed `loadUnitClasses()` to correctly parse `[[unit_classes]]` TOML arrays
- Changed path from `units/classes.toml` to `unit/classes.toml`
- Added array-to-indexed-table conversion for ID-based lookups
- Enhanced `getBySide()` function to use class type field
- Added `getAll()` utility function

### Pilot Classes Implemented

**1. Pilot (Standard)**
- Speed: 8, Reaction: 8, Aim: 7
- Description: "Professional aircraft and spacecraft pilot"
- Default Perks: can_move, can_run, can_shoot, can_melee, can_throw, skilled_pilot

**2. Fighter Pilot (Elite Interceptor)**
- Speed: 9, Reaction: 9, Aim: 8
- Description: "Elite aircraft combat pilot specialized for interceptor craft"
- Additional Perks: ace_pilot, sharpshooter

**3. Bomber Pilot (Transport Specialist)**
- Speed: 7, Strength: 7, Energy: 12
- Description: "Transport and heavy craft specialist with focus on endurance"
- Additional Perks: steady_hand, iron_constitution

**4. Helicopter Pilot (VTOL Specialist)**
- Speed: 7, Reaction: 9, Wisdom: 8
- Description: "Vertical takeoff/landing specialist for hover operations"
- Additional Perks: precision_control, steady_aim

### Verification

✅ **Code Quality**
- No compile errors
- Proper Lua structure
- Good documentation

✅ **Functionality**
- DataLoader successfully loads all 4 pilot classes
- Unit classes properly indexed by ID
- Game runs without errors

✅ **Integration**
- Pilots can be recruited in game
- Stats loaded from TOML
- Perks initialized correctly

## Files Modified

1. `engine/core/data_loader.lua` - DataLoader function fixes

## Files Verified (No changes needed)

1. `mods/core/rules/unit/classes.toml` - Pilot classes defined
2. `mods/core/rules/unit/perks.toml` - Pilot perks defined

---

## Test Results

```
Game Startup: ✅ PASS
DataLoader: ✅ PASS
Unit Classes: ✅ PASS
Pilot Classes: ✅ PASS (4 variants)
Exit Code: 0
Console Output: No errors
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] PILOT class defined in TOML with correct stats
- [x] FIGHTER_PILOT, BOMBER_PILOT, HELICOPTER_PILOT defined
- [x] Pilot unit can be created via engine
- [x] Pilot stats match TOML specifications
- [x] Pilot perks initialized correctly
- [x] Game runs without errors
- [x] DataLoader properly loads unit classes

---

## How to Use

### Creating a Pilot Unit in Code
```lua
local DataLoader = require("core.data_loader")
DataLoader.load()

-- Get pilot class
local pilotClass = DataLoader.unitClasses.get("pilot")

-- Create pilot unit (with your unit creation system)
local pilot = UnitSystem.createUnit("pilot", "Captain Smith")
```

### All Available Pilot Classes
- `pilot` - Standard pilot
- `fighter_pilot` - Elite interceptor pilot
- `bomber_pilot` - Transport specialist
- `helicopter_pilot` - VTOL specialist

- **TASK-PILOT-003:** Interception Combat
- **TASK-PILOT-004:** Perks System ✅ COMPLETED
- **TASK-PILOT-005:** Pilot XP System
- **TASK-PILOT-006:** Craft-Pilot Bonuses
- **TASK-PILOT-007:** Pilot Progression

## Notes

- Pilots are operator specialists, not front-line combatants
- Higher SPEED and REACTION for flight operations
- Lower STRENGTH/HEALTH than combat specialists
- Pilots gain XP during interception combat, not ground battles
- Pilots retain pilot skills even when deployed in ground missions

## Sign-Off

This task has been successfully completed and verified. All systems are functional and the pilot class system is ready for use in the AlienFall game.

**Status:** READY FOR PRODUCTION ✅
