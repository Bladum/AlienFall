- TOML-based configuration enables easy modding
- Data Loader extends to support new content types
- All systems support save/load for persistence

---

## Alignment with Design Principles

### Docs-Engine-Mods Alignment

**✅ Docs (Game Design):**
- `docs/progression/` - Faction, progression, difficulty design
- `docs/lore/` - Technology phases, narrative hooks
- `docs/content/` - Units, weapons, crafts, facilities

**✅ Engine (Implementation):**
- `engine/geoscape/faction_system.lua` - Faction management
- `engine/geoscape/progression_manager.lua` - Progression tracking
- `engine/core/automation_system.lua` - Task automation
- `engine/core/difficulty_manager.lua` - Difficulty scaling
- `engine/lore/narrative_hooks.lua` - Narrative delivery

**✅ Mods (Configuration):**
- `mods/core/technology/phase*.toml` - Technology content
- `mods/core/lore/narrative/narrative_events.toml` - Narrative content
- `mods/core/examples/` - Modding templates

### Independence
- Engine code doesn't reference specific mod content
- All content configurable through mod files
- Systems functional without specific mods
- Modders can replace entire faction/tech trees

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ Modular system design enables independent development  
✅ TOML configuration separates code from content  
✅ Consistent patterns make systems easy to understand  
✅ Save/load support from the start ensures persistence  
✅ Example content helps modders get started quickly  

### Technical Decisions
- Used Lua docstrings throughout for IDE support
- TOML for all content (no Lua configuration)
- Module-based architecture (no globals)
- Priority-based effect application
- Track both state and save data separately

### Process Improvements
- Creating documentation alongside code improves clarity
- Examples of similar systems help with consistency
- Separating concerns makes testing easier
- Save/load support must come early, not late
