## ðŸ“‹ ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Move Task-Specific Documentation to DONE (with tasks)

When moving these TASK files to DONE, include their supporting documentation:

**TASK-029 â†’ DONE (with 6 supporting docs)**
- TASK-029-mission-deployment-planning-screen.md
- TASK-029-DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md
- TASK-029-FINAL-COMPLETION-REPORT.md
- TASK-029-FINAL-DELIVERY-CHECKLIST.md
- TASK-029-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md
- TASK-029-IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md
- TASK-029-READY-FOR-INTEGRATION.md

**TASK-027 â†’ Already in DONE (add supporting docs if not already there)**
- TASK-027-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md
- TASK-027-QUICK-REFERENCE.md
- TASK-027-VISUAL-OVERVIEW.md

### Phase 2: Delete or Archive General Reports (14 Files)

Move to `tasks/ARCHIVE/` or delete:
- BATCH_6_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- PROJECT-UPDATE-OCT-21.md
- QUICK-STATUS-SUMMARY.md
- PROJECT-RESTRUCTURE-PLAN.md
- RESTRUCTURE-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md
- TASK-ARCHIVAL-PLAN.md
- TASK-AUDIT-STATUS-REPORT.md
- And others from GROUP A-H above

### Phase 3: Delete or Archive Geoscape/Map Gen Documentation (14 Files)

These reference documents should move to `wiki/systems/` or be archived:
- GEOSCAPE-*.md files (10 files)
- MAP-GENERATION-*.md files (4 files)
- LORE-*.md files (2 files)
- IMPLEMENTATION-VS-DESIGN-ALIGNMENT.md
- MISSION-SYSTEM-*.md files (2 files)
- PHASE-*.md files (3 files)
- ENGINE-RESTRUCTURE-*.md files (2 files)

### Phase 4: Verify Remaining Task Files

For the 6 task files to keep:

1. **TASK-029-mission-deployment-planning-screen.md**
   - Check: Is it implemented in engine/battlescape/logic/ ?
   - If YES: Move to DONE with supporting docs
   - If NO: Keep in TODO

2. **TASK-FIX-ENGINE-ALIGNMENT.md**
   - Keep: Currently active, in-progress

3. **TASK-MRT-migrate-roadmap-to-tasks.md**
   - Keep: TODO task, needs to be done

4. **TASK-VDG-create-visual-diagrams.md**
   - Keep: TODO task, medium priority

5. **TASK-000-DOCUMENTATION-IMPROVEMENTS.md**
   - Status unclear: Check if improvements were applied
   - If YES and complete: Move to DONE
   - If NO or partial: Keep in TODO

6. **TASK-COMBAT-BREAKDOWN.md**
   - Type: Reference breakdown document, not a task
   - Action: Consider archiving or moving to wiki/references/

---

## ðŸš€ RECOMMENDED EXECUTION

### Step 1: Verify TASK-029 Implementation (15 min)
```
Check: engine/battlescape/logic/deployment_*.lua exists?
If YES â†’ Move to DONE with all 7 supporting files
If NO â†’ Keep in TODO
```

### Step 2: Verify TASK-000 Status (10 min)
```
Check: Were documentation improvements actually made?
If YES â†’ Move to DONE
If NO â†’ Keep in TODO (needs implementation)
```

### Step 3: Archive Reports (10 min)
```
Create: tasks/ARCHIVE/ folder
Move: BATCH_6, PROJECT-UPDATE, QUICK-STATUS, and other reports
```

### Step 4: Delete Reference Docs (5 min)
```
Delete or Archive: GEOSCAPE-*, MAP-GENERATION-*, LORE-*, etc.
These belong in wiki/ or ARCHIVE/, not TODO/
```

### Step 5: Verify Final State (5 min)
```
TODO/ should have:
- 6 task files (or fewer if some move to DONE)
- 6 reference/navigation files
- Total: ~10-12 files (clean and focused)
```

---

## ðŸ“Š BEFORE/AFTER

**BEFORE:** 48 mixed files (tasks, reports, references, docs)
- Confusing which files are actual tasks
- Task-specific docs scattered
- Hard to focus on what needs to be done

**AFTER:** 10-12 focused files
- Clear separation of tasks vs. reference
- Task-specific docs grouped with tasks in DONE
- Easy to identify what needs work
