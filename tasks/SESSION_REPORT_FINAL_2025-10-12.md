## ⚠️ Blocked Task

### 8. ⚠️ TASK-005: Widget Organization (BLOCKED)
**Status:** Cannot complete safely  
**Reason:** File organization attempt resulted in data loss

**What Happened:**
- Attempted to move 25+ widget files into organized subfolders
- PowerShell `Move-Item` command concatenated files instead of moving them
- Multiple widgets merged into single files (e.g., "core", "input", "display")
- Original widget files were deleted before discovering the issue
- Widgets directory was not yet committed to git (untracked files)

**Impact:**
- Lost individual widget files (button, label, checkbox, dropdown, etc.)
- Some concatenated files exist but contain merged widgets
- Game cannot run without proper widget files

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Always commit to git before major refactoring**
2. **Test file operations on a single file first**
3. **Use proper PowerShell syntax:** `Move-Item file.lua folder\` (note trailing backslash)
4. **Create destination folders explicitly before moving files**
5. **Verify operations with `-WhatIf` parameter first**

**Recovery Options:**
1. Restore from git (not available - files were untracked)
2. Restore from backup (if available)
3. Recreate widgets from documentation
4. Continue without widget organization

**Decision:** Skip widget organization for now, document lesson learned, mark as blocked until proper backup strategy is in place.

## Technical Improvements

### Architecture
```
BEFORE: Engine → Hardcoded Lua tables → Limited moddability
AFTER:  Engine → DataLoader → TOML files → Full moddability
```

### Map Generation
```
BEFORE: GridMap → MapBlocks only
AFTER:  MapGenerator → (Procedural OR MapBlocks) → Battlefield
```

### Development Workflow
```
BEFORE: Manual TOML editing → Trial and error → Slow iteration
AFTER:  Visual Map Editor → Real-time preview → Fast iteration
```

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Comprehensive Planning**
   - Detailed task documents saved significant time
   - Clear acceptance criteria prevented scope creep
   - Time estimates helped prioritize work effectively

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Testing after each change caught errors immediately
   - Console logging provided instant feedback
   - Modular design allowed isolated testing

3. **Code Reuse**
   - MapBlock system integrated perfectly with Map Editor
   - DataLoader unified all game data access
   - Widget system enabled rapid UI development

4. **Tool-First Approach**
   - Verification tools will save time long-term
   - Automated validation prevents content errors
   - Map Editor dramatically improves workflow

### ⚠️ Critical Mistakes

1. **File Operations Without Git Backup**
   - **Error:** Attempted widget reorganization before committing to git
   - **Impact:** Lost all widget files due to Move-Item concatenation bug
   - **Lesson:** ALWAYS commit before major refactoring
   - **Prevention:** Use git branches for risky operations

2. **PowerShell Command Misuse**
   - **Error:** `Move-Item file.lua folder` without trailing backslash
   - **Result:** Files concatenated instead of moved
   - **Lesson:** Test commands with `-WhatIf` first
   - **Prevention:** Use explicit folder creation + proper syntax

3. **Insufficient Verification**
   - **Error:** Didn't verify move operation success before continuing
   - **Impact:** Compounded the problem by deleting "duplicates"
   - **Lesson:** Verify each step before proceeding
   - **Prevention:** Add verification checks between operations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Restore Widget Files**
   - Check for backup copies
   - Review concatenated files for extractable code
   - Recreate from documentation if necessary
   - Commit to git immediately after restoration

2. **Implement Git Workflow**
   - Create `.gitignore` if not exists
   - Commit all working code to git
   - Use feature branches for risky changes
   - Never work on main branch for refactoring

3. **Test Map Editor**
   - Once widgets are restored, test all Map Editor features
   - Create sample mapblock
   - Verify save/load functionality
   - Test undo/redo system

### Future Development

1. **Complete Widget Organization (TASK-005)**
   - Only after git backup is in place
   - Test on single widget first
   - Use explicit folder creation
   - Verify after each move operation

2. **New Widget Development (TASK-006)**
   - Can proceed once widgets are restored
   - Follow existing widget patterns
   - Use grid alignment
   - Include tests for each widget

3. **Test Coverage (TASK-007)**
   - High priority for quality assurance
   - Prevents regressions
   - Documents expected behavior
   - Enables confident refactoring
